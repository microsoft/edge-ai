## Prerequisites Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive prerequisites for successfully implementing the Quality Process Optimization Automation scenario. These requirements are organized by category and implementation phase to support systematic planning and risk assessment.

**Critical Success Factors:** Quality process optimization automation requires robust data infrastructure for real-time quality monitoring, established quality management processes that can be digitized, and cross-functional collaboration between quality, operations, and IT teams. Success depends on having reliable sensor data from quality control equipment and the organizational capability to act on AI-driven insights.

**Risk Mitigation:** Proper prerequisite fulfillment mitigates risks of poor data quality affecting AI model accuracy, resistance to automated quality processes, and integration challenges with existing quality management systems. Comprehensive prerequisites ensure smooth transition from manual to automated quality processes while maintaining regulatory compliance.

**Assessment Approach:** Organizations should assess their readiness through quality data maturity evaluations, process digitization readiness assessments, and organizational change management capability reviews. Each prerequisite should be validated through pilot testing and stakeholder readiness interviews.

Each prerequisite is marked as either **Mandatory** (required for successful implementation) or **Recommended** (enhances success probability and long-term value).
