## Prerequisites Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive prerequisites for successfully implementing the Yield Process Optimization scenario. These requirements are organized by category and implementation phase to support systematic planning and risk assessment.

**Critical Success Factors:** Yield optimization requires comprehensive process data infrastructure, established manufacturing process controls with documented parameters, and data-driven decision-making capabilities. Success depends on having reliable sensor networks across production equipment and the organizational capability to implement automated process adjustments based on yield analytics.

**Risk Mitigation:** Proper prerequisite fulfillment mitigates risks of poor data quality affecting optimization algorithms, process instability during automation transitions, and integration challenges with existing manufacturing execution systems. Comprehensive prerequisites ensure smooth evolution from manual to automated yield optimization while maintaining production stability.

**Assessment Approach:** Organizations should assess their readiness through manufacturing data maturity evaluations, process control capability assessments, and yield improvement project retrospectives. Each prerequisite should be validated through process mapping exercises and historical yield data analysis.

Each prerequisite is marked as either **Mandatory** (required for successful implementation) or **Recommended** (enhances success probability and long-term value).
