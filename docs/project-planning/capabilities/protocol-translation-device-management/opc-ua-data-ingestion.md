## Abstract Description

OPC UA Data Ingestion is a comprehensive industrial communication capability that enables enterprise-grade connectivity and real-time data acquisition from industrial automation systems through standardized OPC UA protocol implementation, providing seamless integration with programmable logic controllers, SCADA systems, and manufacturing execution systems.
This capability provides industrial-grade OPC UA client implementation, high-performance data collection with configurable sampling and subscription management, sophisticated data modeling with automatic address space discovery,
and scalable connection management with failover capabilities that collectively deliver unified industrial data access, real-time production monitoring, and comprehensive asset visibility for manufacturing, process automation, and industrial IoT environments.
The platform integrates seamlessly with Azure Arc-enabled edge infrastructure to provide secure, scalable, and reliable industrial data acquisition that ensures millisecond data collection latencies while maintaining the deterministic communication requirements of industrial operations,
ultimately enabling organizations to achieve unified operational data management and real-time production intelligence rather than fragmented data silos that limit manufacturing optimization and business value realization across industrial facilities.
