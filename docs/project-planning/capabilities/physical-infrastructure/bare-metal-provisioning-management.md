## Abstract Description

Bare Metal Provisioning & Management is a comprehensive automated infrastructure lifecycle capability that orchestrates enterprise-grade physical server deployment and management across distributed edge locations through infrastructure-as-code paradigms.
This capability provides zero-touch server provisioning, centralized inventory and asset management, policy-driven configuration management, and automated hardware lifecycle orchestration that eliminates manual configuration processes and reduces deployment time by 80%.

It integrates seamlessly with [Azure Arc][azure-arc] hybrid management plane and enterprise asset management systems to deliver consistent security policies, compliance standards, and operational configurations across all physical infrastructure while enabling predictive capacity planning, automated refresh scheduling, and secure decommissioning processes.
This optimizes total cost of ownership and ensures regulatory compliance throughout the complete server lifecycle.

## Detailed Capability Overview

Bare Metal Provisioning & Management represents a critical foundational capability that transforms traditional manual server deployment and management into fully automated, policy-driven infrastructure operations at enterprise scale. This capability addresses the complex challenges of managing heterogeneous physical server infrastructure across distributed locations while maintaining consistent security, compliance, and operational standards.

The architectural foundation leverages industry-standard protocols including PXE boot, IPMI, and Redfish APIs combined with infrastructure-as-code principles to create reproducible, auditable server deployment processes. This approach eliminates configuration drift, reduces human error, and ensures consistent baseline configurations across all physical infrastructure assets while enabling rapid scaling to support business growth and digital transformation initiatives.
