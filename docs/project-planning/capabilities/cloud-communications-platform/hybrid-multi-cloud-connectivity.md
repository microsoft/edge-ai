## Abstract Description

Hybrid & Multi-Cloud Connectivity is a comprehensive networking and integration capability that enables secure, optimized, and reliable connectivity across on-premises, edge, and multiple cloud environments through enterprise-grade networking infrastructure, automated connectivity orchestration, and unified network governance.
This capability provides software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) with intelligent path selection and quality of service management, comprehensive multi-cloud networking with cross-cloud connectivity and unified network policies, enterprise-grade VPN and private connectivity with dedicated circuits and encrypted tunnels.
These capabilities include advanced network security with zero-trust networking and threat protection that collectively deliver seamless hybrid operations, optimal network performance, and comprehensive security for distributed computing environments.
The platform integrates seamlessly with Azure ExpressRoute, Virtual WAN, and enterprise networking solutions to provide enterprise-scale connectivity infrastructure that ensures sub-50ms latency between cloud regions while maintaining comprehensive security controls and compliance capabilities.
This ultimately enables organizations to achieve unified hybrid networking and optimal multi-cloud performance rather than fragmented connectivity that creates operational complexity and performance bottlenecks across distributed infrastructure.
