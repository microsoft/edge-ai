## Abstract Description

Edge High Availability & Disaster Recovery is a comprehensive business continuity and resilience orchestration capability that enables enterprise-grade fault tolerance, automated failover, and disaster recovery procedures for mission-critical edge computing environments at scale across thousands of distributed locations.
This capability provides automated redundancy management, intelligent failover orchestration, cross-site data replication, and comprehensive business continuity planning for edge infrastructure and applications that require 99.99% availability and sub-15-minute recovery times.
The platform supports manufacturing automation, industrial control systems, and real-time analytics platforms through seamless integration with Azure Site Recovery, Kubernetes cluster federation, distributed storage systems, and network redundancy solutions.
These integrations deliver automated disaster detection, orchestrated recovery procedures, and comprehensive business continuity validation that ensures operational resilience for edge AI/ML pipelines, industrial IoT platforms, and autonomous manufacturing systems while maintaining regulatory compliance and comprehensive audit capabilities.

## Detailed Capability Overview

Edge High Availability & Disaster Recovery represents a critical foundational resilience capability that addresses the complex challenges of ensuring business continuity and operational resilience for distributed edge computing environments. Traditional centralized disaster recovery approaches fail to meet the demanding requirements of real-time manufacturing operations, safety-critical control systems, and mission-critical edge applications that cannot tolerate extended downtime or data loss.
This capability bridges the gap between legacy backup and recovery procedures and modern cloud-native resilience paradigms, where edge environments require both the rapid recovery characteristics of local redundancy and the comprehensive protection capabilities of multi-site disaster recovery architectures.

The architectural foundation leverages Kubernetes cluster federation, distributed consensus algorithms, and advanced orchestration engines to create a unified resilience fabric that spans edge clusters, industrial control systems, and cloud backup services while maintaining the sub-second failover requirements for manufacturing safety systems and the comprehensive data protection necessary for preserving critical business operations and intellectual property during catastrophic failures.
This capability's strategic positioning within the broader edge computing ecosystem enables organizations to implement modern business continuity practices, automated disaster recovery procedures, and comprehensive resilience testing while maintaining compatibility with existing industrial safety systems and ensuring compliance with business continuity regulations that are essential for manufacturing operations, financial services,
and critical infrastructure across distributed edge environments.
