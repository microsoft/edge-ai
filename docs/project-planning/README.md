### ðŸ“‹ Using Scenario Templates for Custom Implementations

When existing scenarios don't perfectly match your use case, use our comprehensive templates to document and plan custom implementations:

#### When to Use Templates

- **Novel Use Cases**: Your requirements don't closely match existing scenarios
- **Hybrid Implementations**: You need to combine elements from multiple scenarios
- **Custom Industries**: Industry-specific requirements not covered by existing scenarios
- **Advanced Integrations**: Complex integrations requiring detailed documentation

#### Template-Driven Planning Process

1. **Start with Scenario Description Template**: Document your business context, technical requirements, and expected outcomes
2. **Use Prerequisites Template**: Identify and document all technical and organizational requirements
3. **Apply Capability Mapping Template**: Map your requirements to platform capabilities with detailed analysis
4. **Create Implementation README**: Use the README template to organize resources and guide implementation

#### Template Benefits

- **Structured Analysis**: Comprehensive framework ensures nothing is overlooked
- **Consistent Documentation**: Standardized format improves communication and knowledge sharing
- **Integration Ready**: Templates designed to integrate with existing project planning workflows
- **Community Contribution**: Well-documented custom scenarios can be contributed back to the community

**ðŸ“– See the [Templates Guide][templates-guide] for detailed template documentation and usage instructions.**

### ðŸš€ Accelerating Development with Existing Components

Leverage pre-built components in the `/src` directory to accelerate your scenario implementation:

#### Component Categories

Our platform includes ready-to-use components organized by capability:

- **Edge Applications** (`/src/100-edge/500-applications/`): AI/ML inferencing, camera integration, and application frameworks
- **Edge Orchestration** (`/src/100-edge/100-cncf-cluster/`): Kubernetes clustering and container orchestration
- **Edge Observability** (`/src/100-edge/120-observability/`): Data flows, monitoring, and telemetry collection
- **Cloud Platform** (`/src/000-cloud/`): Azure Arc integration and cloud services
- **Provider Registration** (`/src/azure-resource-providers/`): Azure resource setup and configuration
- **Tools and Utilities** (`/src/900-tools-utilities/`): Supporting tooling and automation scripts

#### Component Discovery Process

1. **Review Scenario Documentation**: Existing scenarios contain component references showing proven integration patterns
2. **Analyze Capability Mappings**: Use capability documentation to identify relevant components
3. **Explore Component README Files**: Each component includes detailed documentation and usage examples
4. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure your environment meets component requirements

#### Integration Patterns

- **Reference Links**: Scenarios include direct links to relevant components (e.g., `[inferencing]: /src/100-edge/500-applications/README.md`)
- **Capability Mapping**: Capabilities documentation maps platform features to implementation components
- **Dependency Management**: Components are designed to work together with clear dependency patterns

**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Start by reviewing scenarios similar to your use case to identify the components that accelerated those implementations.
