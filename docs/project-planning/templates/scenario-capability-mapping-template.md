## Capability Mapping Overview

This document provides detailed capability analysis for the [Scenario Name] scenario, including comprehensive scoring, implementation phase mapping, and integration pattern analysis. The analysis follows the standard four-dimensional evaluation framework used across the Edge AI Platform.

**Evaluation Framework:** Each capability is evaluated across four dimensions using a 0-10 scale:

- **Technical Fit (TF):** How well the capability matches scenario requirements
- **Business Value (BV):** Business impact and value creation potential
- **Implementation Practicality (IP):** Ease of implementation and resource requirements
- **Platform Cohesion (PC):** Integration benefits and cross-capability synergies

**Implementation Phases:** Capabilities are organized into four implementation phases:

- **PoC Phase (2-4 weeks):** Foundation capabilities for proof of concept
- **PoV Phase (6-12 weeks):** Value demonstration and business validation
- **Production Phase (3-6 months):** Operational deployment and integration
- **Scale Phase (6-18 months):** Enterprise transformation and optimization
