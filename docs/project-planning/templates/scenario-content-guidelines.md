# Scenario Content Guidelines & Style Requirements

**Based on**: Digital Inspection Survey scenario analysis
**Purpose**: Content standards for scenario documentation consistency
**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-18

## Content Strategy & Approach

### Target Audience Profile
- **Primary**: Technical architects, engineering managers, DevOps engineers
- **Secondary**: IT decision makers, project managers, implementation teams
- **Expertise Level**: Expert-level technical knowledge assumed
- **Context**: Evaluating and implementing industrial IoT and edge AI solutions

### Content Positioning
- **Technical Implementation Guide**: Focus on "how to build" rather than "why to buy"
- **Practical Deployment**: Realistic timelines, resource requirements, technical complexity
- **Capability-Driven**: Organized around specific technical capabilities and their integration
- **Phase-Based Progression**: Clear advancement from PoC through enterprise scale

## Writing Style Standards

### Voice & Tone Guidelines

#### Technical Authority
- Write as subject matter experts for expert audiences
- Assume familiarity with industrial IoT, edge computing, and AI/ML concepts
- Use industry-standard terminology without over-explanation
- Provide specific technical details and implementation requirements

#### Implementation Focus
- Emphasize practical deployment steps and technical integration
- Include realistic resource requirements (team size, timelines, skills)
- Specify technical dependencies and prerequisites
- Focus on capability delivery and measurable outcomes

#### Professional Directness
- Clear, concise sentences without unnecessary elaboration
- Specific, quantifiable statements rather than general claims
- Direct technical language without marketing positioning
- Factual tone based on implementation experience and industry benchmarks

### Language Standards

#### Approved Technical Terms
- **Capabilities**: Specific technical functions provided by the platform
- **Implementation**: Technical deployment and configuration activities
- **Integration**: Technical connection between systems and platforms
- **Deployment**: Technical installation and configuration processes
- **Optimization**: Technical improvement of system performance
- **Analytics**: Technical data processing and insight generation

#### Prohibited Sales Language
- ❌ "Game-changing", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge", "innovative"
- ❌ "Seamless", "effortless", "simple", "easy"
- ❌ "Best-in-class", "industry-leading", "world-class"
- ❌ "Transform your business", "unlock potential", "drive growth"
- ❌ "Competitive advantage", "market differentiation", "strategic edge"

#### Approved Improvement Language
- ✅ "15-25% improvement in [specific metric]"
- ✅ "Reduction in [specific operational challenge]"
- ✅ "Enhancement of [specific technical capability]"
- ✅ "Optimization of [specific process or system]"
- ✅ "Automation of [specific manual activity]"

## Content Organization Standards

### Section Structure Requirements

#### Scenario Overview
- **Technical Description**: What the scenario technically accomplishes
- **Technology Integration**: How specific technologies work together
- **Business Context**: Specific use cases and operational requirements
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Quantified improvements with realistic ranges

#### Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase Progression**: Logical technical advancement (PoC → PoV → Production → Scale)
- **Capability Mapping**: Specific technical capabilities required per phase
- **Resource Requirements**: Realistic team sizes, skills, and timelines
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable technical and business validation points

#### Business Planning
- **Investment Levels**: Realistic resource requirements per phase
- **ROI Projections**: Conservative, achievable improvement ranges
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical and operational risks with specific mitigation
- **Timeline to Value**: Realistic time frames for benefit realization

### Content Depth Standards

#### Technical Specifications
- **Capability Requirements**: Specific technical functions needed
- **Integration Points**: Exact system connections and data flows
- **Performance Metrics**: Quantified success criteria and KPIs
- **Implementation Steps**: Week-by-week technical progression

#### Business Context
- **Operational Impact**: Specific process improvements and efficiency gains
- **Resource Allocation**: Team composition, skills, and time investment
- **Success Validation**: Measurable criteria for phase advancement
- **Risk Management**: Technical and operational risk mitigation strategies

## Quality Standards & Validation

### Content Accuracy Requirements

#### Technical Validation
- All capability references must link to existing, documented capabilities
- Implementation timelines must be based on realistic project experience
- Resource requirements must reflect actual implementation complexity
- Integration requirements must be technically feasible and specific

#### Business Accuracy
- ROI projections must be conservative and industry-benchmark-based
- Timeline to value must reflect realistic implementation and adoption curves
- Risk assessments must be based on common implementation challenges
- Success criteria must be measurable and achievable

#### Link Validation
- All capability group links must resolve to actual documentation
- Individual capability links must point to specific capability descriptions
- Cross-scenario references must link to existing scenario documentation
- External references must be validated and current

### Content Consistency Standards

#### Formatting Requirements
- Consistent emoji usage for section headers and phase indicators
- Standardized table structures with appropriate markdownlint exclusions
- Reference-style links grouped by category at document end
- Consistent front matter with all required metadata fields

#### Tone Consistency
- Technical authority maintained throughout all sections
- Implementation focus consistent from overview through detailed phases
- Professional directness without variation in formality level
- Factual presentation without promotional language

## Measurement & Success Criteria

### Content Effectiveness Metrics

#### Technical Accuracy
