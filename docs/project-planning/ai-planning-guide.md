## Overview

This guide shows you how to leverage GitHub Copilot and our specialized project planning prompt to accelerate your edge AI project planning process.

**ðŸ“‹ For comprehensive project planning overview, see the [Project Planning README][project-planning-readme] which includes:**

- Complete scenarios library with implementation examples
- Platform capabilities documentation and mapping
- Templates for custom scenario development
- Component acceleration using existing /src implementations
- Step-by-step planning methodology

## Quick Start: AI-Powered Project Planning

### 1. Load the Project Planning Prompt

In GitHub Copilot Chat, reference our specialized project planning prompt:

```text
@workspace Use the edge-ai-project-planning.prompt.md to help me plan my edge AI project
```

### 2. Describe Your Project

Provide a clear description of your project objectives, context, and requirements:

```text
I'm planning an edge AI project for [your industry/use case]. Here's my project description:

[Paste your project description here - include business objectives, technical requirements, constraints, timeline, etc.]

Help me:
1. Identify relevant scenarios from the documentation
2. Map my requirements to platform capabilities
3. Create a preliminary implementation plan
4. Identify prerequisites and potential challenges
```

### 3. Interactive Planning Session

The AI assistant will guide you through a structured planning process:

- **Scenario Analysis**: Matching your needs to documented implementation scenarios
- **Capability Mapping**: Identifying required platform capabilities and dependencies
- **Implementation Planning**: Creating a phased roadmap for your project
- **Risk Assessment**: Highlighting potential challenges and mitigation strategies

## Example Planning Sessions

### Manufacturing Quality Control

```text
I'm planning an edge AI project for automated quality control in our electronics manufacturing line. We want to:

- Detect defects in real-time during production
- Reduce manual inspection overhead by 80%
- Integrate with our existing MES system
- Deploy across 5 manufacturing lines initially
- Scale to 20+ lines within 12 months

We have basic IoT sensors but limited AI/ML experience. Our network infrastructure is good but we need to maintain strict quality compliance.

Help me plan this implementation.
```

**Expected AI Response**: Analysis mapping to Digital Inspection & Survey scenario, required capabilities (Cloud AI Platform, Edge Cluster Platform, etc.), phased implementation plan, and risk mitigation strategies.

### Predictive Maintenance

```text
I need to implement predictive maintenance for our industrial equipment fleet:

- 200+ pieces of critical equipment across 3 facilities
- Currently reactive maintenance causing 15% unplanned downtime
- Goal: Reduce unplanned downtime to <5%
- Have vibration, temperature, and pressure sensors on most equipment
- Need integration with existing CMMS system
- Compliance with ISO 55000 asset management standards

Our team has data analytics skills but limited ML experience. Budget approved for 18-month implementation.

Create a comprehensive implementation plan.
```

**Expected AI Response**: Analysis mapping to Predictive Maintenance scenario, capability requirements, skills development plan, compliance considerations, and detailed 18-month roadmap.

## Advanced Planning Techniques

### Iterative Refinement

Work iteratively with the AI to refine your plan:

```text
Based on your analysis, I have some additional constraints:
- Must integrate with our existing SAP system
- Need to comply with FDA regulations
- Budget limit of $500K for pilot phase
- Team of 3 developers, 1 data scientist

How does this change your recommendations?
```

### Scenario Comparison

Compare multiple scenarios for complex projects:

```text
My project could fit multiple scenarios - both operational monitoring and predictive maintenance. Help me:

1. Compare the complexity and ROI of each approach
2. Understand if I can implement both incrementally
3. Recommend which to start with for maximum impact
4. Plan a roadmap that builds from one to the other
```

### Capability Deep Dive

Get detailed analysis of specific capabilities:

```text
I'm particularly interested in the Cloud AI Platform capabilities. For my [specific use case], help me understand:

1. What specific AI/ML services I'll need
2. How to integrate with edge inference
3. Training data requirements and management
4. Model deployment and updating strategies
```

### Custom Scenario Development

When existing scenarios don't perfectly match your needs, leverage our comprehensive templates:

```text
I have a unique edge AI use case that doesn't perfectly match your existing scenarios. Help me use the scenario templates to:

1. Document my custom requirements systematically
2. Map my needs to platform capabilities
3. Create a structured implementation plan
4. Identify components that can accelerate development

My use case: [Describe your unique requirements and context]
```

**Expected AI Response**: Guidance on using scenario description template, capability mapping process, identification of relevant existing components, and structured planning approach.

### Template-Driven Planning

Create comprehensive documentation for complex implementations:

```text
I need to create detailed documentation for a complex edge AI implementation that combines elements from multiple scenarios. Guide me through using the templates to:

1. Structure comprehensive requirements analysis
2. Document prerequisite assessment
3. Create detailed capability mappings
4. Plan integration with existing components in /src

Help me organize this documentation systematically.
```

**Expected AI Response**: Step-by-step template usage guidance, integration planning, component acceleration recommendations, and documentation organization strategies.

## Best Practices for AI-Assisted Planning

### Provide Rich Context

The more context you provide, the better the planning assistance:

- **Business Context**: Industry, company size, objectives, success criteria
- **Technical Context**: Current infrastructure, team skills, technology constraints
- **Operational Context**: Compliance requirements, timeline, budget, risk tolerance

### Ask Specific Questions

Get more targeted assistance with specific questions:

- "What are the key technical risks for this implementation?"
- "How should I sequence capability deployment to minimize risk?"
- "What skills development will my team need?"
- "How can I validate this approach with a small pilot?"

### Validate Recommendations

Use the AI to validate your own ideas:

```text
I'm thinking about starting with operational monitoring and then adding predictive capabilities. Does this align with best practices? What are the pros and cons of this approach?
```

### Plan for Iteration

Treat planning as an iterative process:

```text
We've completed our pilot implementation. Based on lessons learned [describe what you learned], how should we adjust our plan for production rollout?
```

## Integration with Documentation

The AI assistant has deep knowledge of all project planning documentation:

- **Scenarios**: Detailed implementation guidance for real-world use cases
- **Capabilities**: Comprehensive platform capability documentation
- **Prerequisites**: Technical and organizational preparation requirements
- **Best Practices**: Proven approaches and lessons learned
- **Comprehensive Mappings**: 30+ industry scenarios mapped to platform capabilities with technical fit analysis
- **Industry Overview**: Complete catalog of scenarios across 8 industry pillars
- **Mapping Methodology**: Systematic approach for scenario-capability evaluation

The assistant will always reference relevant documentation sections and provide links for deeper exploration.

### Leveraging Comprehensive Reference Materials

The AI assistant can help you navigate the extensive reference materials:

```text
Based on the comprehensive scenario mapping, help me compare these 3 scenarios for my manufacturing use case and recommend the best starting point.
```

```text
Using the industry scenarios overview, identify all scenarios relevant to [specific industry] and rank them by implementation complexity.
```

## Getting the Most Value

### Start with Clear Objectives

- Define specific business outcomes you want to achieve
- Identify measurable success criteria
- Understand your constraints and requirements
