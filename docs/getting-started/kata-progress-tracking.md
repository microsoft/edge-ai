# Kata Progress Tracking - User Guide

## Overview

The PraxisWorx learning environment includes interactive progress tracking that helps you monitor your advancement through kata exercises and enables enhanced AI coaching support.

## Getting Started

### What is Progress Tracking?

Progress tracking transforms the checkboxes in kata exercises from static elements into interactive tools that:

- Remember your progress across browser sessions
- Provide visual feedback on completion status
- Enable the kata coach to understand your learning state
- Help you resume work from where you left off

### How It Works

When you open any kata in the local docsify environment, you'll see:

1. **Interactive Checkboxes**: Click to mark tasks as complete
2. **Progress Bar**: Visual indicator showing overall completion
3. **Progress Statistics**: Percentage and task count displays
4. **Persistent State**: Your progress saves automatically

## Using Progress Tracking

### Marking Tasks Complete

Simply click the checkbox next to any task to mark it as complete:

```markdown
- [x] ✅ Completed task (checked)
- [ ] ❌ Pending task (unchecked)
```

**What Happens When You Check a Task:**

- Checkbox state saves automatically to your browser
- Progress bar updates in real-time
- Task gets visual styling to indicate completion
- Kata coach becomes aware of your progress

### Progress Visualization

At the top of each kata, you'll see a progress container showing:

- **Progress Bar**: Filled portion represents completion percentage
- **Percentage**: Numeric completion percentage (e.g., "60%")
- **Task Count**: Completed vs. total tasks (e.g., "6 of 10 tasks completed")

### Session Resumption

Your progress persists automatically:

- **Page Reload**: All checked tasks remain checked
- **Browser Restart**: Progress survives browser sessions
- **Returning Later**: Pick up exactly where you left off
- **Multiple Katas**: Each kata maintains separate progress

## Enhanced AI Coaching

### Progress-Aware Guidance

The PraxisWorx Kata Coach uses your progress data to provide better guidance:

**For New Sessions:**
> "I see you've already completed the setup tasks. Would you like to continue from where you left off or start fresh?"

**For In-Progress Sessions:**
> "Since you've already mastered [completed tasks], let's focus on the core challenge of [next task area]"

**For Stalled Progress:**
> "I notice you moved quickly through the research tasks but seem to be spending time on implementation. Let's explore what's challenging you there."

### Getting Contextual Help

When using the kata coach, mention your current situation:

- "I'm stuck on the deployment task"
- "I need help with the testing phase"
- "Can you review my progress so far?"

The coach will reference your completed tasks to provide targeted guidance.

## Privacy and Data

### What Data is Stored

Progress tracking stores:

### Clearing Progress Data

To reset all kata progress:

1. **Browser Settings**: Clear localStorage/site data

- Use screenshots to document progress for discussions
- Consider exporting progress data for team reviews

## Tips for Success

### Maximizing Learning Value

- **Break Down Large Tasks**: If a task feels overwhelming, create subtasks
- **Regular Check-ins**: Use progress visualization to maintain momentum
- **Celebrate Milestones**: Acknowledge progress achievements
- **Reflect on Patterns**: Notice what types of tasks you complete quickly vs. slowly

### Working with the Kata Coach

- **Be Specific**: Reference exact tasks when asking for help
- **Share Context**: Mention your progress state when requesting guidance
