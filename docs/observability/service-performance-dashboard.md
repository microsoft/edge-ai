## Overview

The `Service Performance Dashboard` provides insights into the resource usage of Kubernetes pods, including memory and CPU utilization. It is designed to help operators monitor and optimize resource allocation by visualizing key metrics.

## Panels Overview

### 1. **Memory Usage**

#### **Memory Usage as % of Pod Memory Requests (All Pods)**

- **Description**: Displays memory usage as a percentage of the total memory requested by each pod in the specified namespace.
- **Metrics Used**:
  - Memory Usage: `node_namespace_pod_container:container_memory_working_set_bytes`
  - Memory Requests: `cluster:namespace:pod_memory:active:kube_pod_container_resource_requests`
- **Thresholds**:
  - Green: Healthy (value < 80%)
  - Red: Critical (value â‰¥ 80%)

#### **Memory Usage as % of Pod Memory Requests (Specific Pod)**

- **Description**: Displays memory usage as a percentage of the total memory requested by a specific pod.
- **Metrics Used**:
  - Memory Usage: `node_namespace_pod_container:container_memory_working_set_bytes`
  - Memory Requests: `cluster:namespace:pod_memory:active:kube_pod_container_resource_requests`
- **Thresholds**:
  - Green: Healthy (value < 80%)
  - Red: Critical (value â‰¥ 80%)

### 2. **CPU Usage**

#### **CPU Usage as % of Pod CPU Requests (All Pods)**

- **Description**: Displays CPU usage as a percentage of the total CPU requested by each pod in the specified namespace.
- **Metrics Used**:
  - CPU Usage: `node_namespace_pod_container:container_cpu_usage_seconds_total:sum_irate`
  - CPU Requests: `cluster:namespace:pod_cpu:active:kube_pod_container_resource_requests`
- **Thresholds**:
  - Green: Healthy (value < 80%)
  - Red: Critical (value â‰¥ 80%)

#### **CPU Usage as % of Pod CPU Requests (Specific Pod)**

- **Description**: Displays CPU usage as a percentage of the total CPU requested by a specific pod.
- **Metrics Used**:
  - CPU Usage: `node_namespace_pod_container:container_cpu_usage_seconds_total:sum_irate`
  - CPU Requests: `cluster:namespace:pod_cpu:active:kube_pod_container_resource_requests`
- **Thresholds**:
  - Green: Healthy (value < 80%)
  - Red: Critical (value â‰¥ 80%)
