This document describes the automated security analysis workflow that leverages Checkov security scanning and creates structured work item planning files for Azure DevOps integration to systematically track and resolve security vulnerabilities in Kubernetes clusters and Arc components.

## Overview

The security analysis workflow provides:

- **Automated Security Scanning**: Uses Checkov with existing [`.checkov.yml`](../.checkov.yml) configuration
- **Focused Component Analysis**: Targets K8s clusters and Arc components specifically
- **Severity-Based Filtering**: Prioritizes findings by security impact
- **Work Item Planning**: Creates structured planning files for Azure DevOps work item creation
- **Interactive Triage**: Optional manual review of security findings

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```powershell
# Run security analysis with default settings (HIGH severity threshold)
.\scripts\Invoke-SecurityAnalysisWithWorkItems.ps1

# Use different severity threshold
.\scripts\Invoke-SecurityAnalysisWithWorkItems.ps1 -SeverityThreshold MEDIUM

# Interactive mode for manual triage
.\scripts\Invoke-SecurityAnalysisWithWorkItems.ps1 -Interactive
```

### Advanced Usage

```powershell
# Specify Azure DevOps project and area path
.\scripts\Invoke-SecurityAnalysisWithWorkItems.ps1 `
    -Project "edge-ai" `
    -AreaPath "edge-ai\\Security" `
    -IterationPath "edge-ai\\Sprint-1"

# Custom output location and configuration
.\scripts\Invoke-SecurityAnalysisWithWorkItems.ps1 `
    -OutputFolder "./custom-security-reports" `
    -ConfigFile "./custom-checkov.yml"
```

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Security Scanning

- Executes [`Run-Checkov.ps1`](../scripts/Run-Checkov.ps1) script with existing configuration
- Scans target K8s and Arc component directories:
  - [`src/100-edge/100-cncf-cluster/`](../src/100-edge/100-cncf-cluster/)
  - [`src/100-edge/110-iot-ops/`](../src/100-edge/110-iot-ops/)
  - [`src/000-cloud/070-kubernetes/`](../src/000-cloud/070-kubernetes/)
- Generates JSON output files for analysis

### Stage 2: Finding Analysis and Filtering

- Parses Checkov JSON output files
- Filters findings to focus on K8s and Arc-related security issues
- Classifies findings by component type:
  - **CNCF-Cluster**: Edge cluster components
  - **IoT-Operations**: IoT operations components
  - **Azure-Kubernetes**: Cloud Kubernetes components
  - **K8s-Arc-Related**: General K8s/Arc findings

### Stage 3: Severity Evaluation and Triage

- Assigns severity levels based on security impact:
  - **CRITICAL**: RBAC, privileged access, admin rights
  - **HIGH**: Security policies, secrets, credentials
  - **MEDIUM**: Resource limits, configurations
  - **LOW**: General recommendations

- Optional interactive triage for manual review
- Filters findings based on severity threshold

### Stage 4: Planning File Generation

- Creates structured planning files following repository conventions defined in [`.github/instructions/ado-wit-planning.instructions.md`](../.github/instructions/ado-wit-planning.instructions.md)

- Generates proper acceptance criteria and story points
- **Note**: This stage creates planning files only - actual Azure DevOps work items are created separately using Copilot chat with the handoff file

## Severity Thresholds

| Threshold  | Includes                  | Use Case                  |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| `CRITICAL` | Only critical findings    | Production emergencies    |
| `HIGH`     | Critical + High findings  | Standard security reviews |
| `MEDIUM`   | Medium severity and above | Comprehensive audits      |
| `LOW`      | All findings              | Development environments  |

├── security-analysis.xml               # JUnit XML report
└── security-analysis-summary.md        # Executive summary

└── planning-log.md                    # Operational state tracking and progress log
```

## Integration with Azure DevOps

The generated planning files follow repository work item planning conventions and can be processed using Copilot chat:

1. **Review Planning Files**: Examine generated work item definitions and acceptance criteria in [`.copilot-tracking`](../.copilot-tracking/) folder
2. **Execute Work Item Creation**: Use Copilot chat with the [`handoff.md`](../.copilot-tracking/workitems/security-analysis/checkov-k8s-arc-findings/handoff.md) file to create actual work items in Azure DevOps
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor resolution through Azure DevOps after work items are created
4. **Follow-up Scanning**: Verify fixes with subsequent security scans
