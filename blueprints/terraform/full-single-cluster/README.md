# Full Single Cluster Blueprint

## Overview

This blueprint provides a complete end-to-end deployment of Azure IoT Operations (AIO) on a single-node, Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. It deploys all necessary components from VM creation to AIO installation, resulting in a fully functional edge computing environment that integrates with Azure cloud services.

## Architecture

This blueprint deploys:

1. A Linux VM host in Azure
2. A K3s Kubernetes cluster on the VM
3. Azure Arc connection for the cluster
4. Cloud resources required by AIO (Key Vault, Storage, etc.)
5. Azure IoT Operations components (MQTT Broker, Data Processor, etc.)
6. Optional messaging and observability components

The resulting architecture provides a unified edge-to-cloud solution with secure communication, data processing capabilities, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with Owner or Contributor access
- Azure CLI installed (version 2.30.0 or later)
- Terraform installed (version 1.0.0 or later)
- Git installed

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Prepare Configuration

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the following required variables:

```hcl
# Required variables
environment     = "dev"                 # Environment type (dev, test, prod)
resource_prefix = "myprefix"            # Short unique prefix for resource naming
location        = "eastus2"             # Azure region location

# Optional (recommended) variables
instance        = "001"                 # Deployment instance number
```

For advanced customization options, review the variables in `variables.tf`.

### 2. Initialize Terraform

```bash
# Set Azure subscription context
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init
```

### 3. Deploy Resources

```bash
# Apply the Terraform configuration
terraform apply
```

### 4. Access Deployed Resources

After successful deployment:

1. **Access the Kubernetes cluster** (in one prompt):

   ```bash
   az connectedk8s proxy -n <cluster-name> -g <resource-group>
   ```

2. **View AIO resources** (in a separate prompt):

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n azure-iot-operations
   ```
