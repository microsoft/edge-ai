## What You'll Learn

Develop proficiency in AI-assisted project onboarding and complete your first successful Edge AI blueprint deployment.

**Learning Objectives**:

- Use getting-started prompt for guided first deployment of the full-single-node-cluster blueprint
- Practice interactive deployment workflows with Azure setup and parameter configuration
- Handle deployment challenges using structured AI assistance and error handling
- Build confidence with real deployment experience through coached practice

**Prerequisites**: Completion of AI Development Fundamentals Kata, basic Azure familiarity, active GitHub Copilot

**Real-World Context**: New team members need to quickly understand project capabilities through hands-on deployment experience. This kata teaches systematic deployment approaches that build confidence and practical understanding of the Edge AI platform.

## Practice Scenario

You're joining a new development team and need to understand their Edge AI platform capabilities through hands-on experience. You must:

- **First Deployment**: Successfully deploy the full-single-node-cluster blueprint using AI-guided assistance
- **Azure Integration**: Configure Azure resources and understand the cloud-to-edge architecture
- **Project Understanding**: Learn the project structure and deployment patterns through practical experience
- **AI Assistance Mastery**: Use getting-started guidance effectively for deployment workflows

**Your Challenge**: Complete your first successful Edge AI deployment using AI-assisted guidance, understanding what you're deploying and why.

**Methodology**: Use guided deployment: (1) Use getting-started prompt for step-by-step deployment, (2) Learn through doing with Azure setup and configuration, (3) Validate deployment success and understand the results

## Tasks

### Task 1: Getting-Started Deployment Initiation (15 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Use the getting-started prompt to begin your first Edge AI deployment

**Resource Context**: Before starting, review the **[Prompts Overview][project-prompts]** to understand how the getting-started prompt guides you through deployment workflows.

**Steps**:

1. **Initiate** deployment guidance
   - [ ] Open GitHub Copilot Chat and reference the getting-started prompt
   - [ ] Try: *"I'm new to this project and want to deploy my first Edge AI solution. Can you guide me through the process?"*
   - [ ] Follow the interactive guidance provided (one question at a time)
   - **Expected result**: Clear understanding of deployment approach and next steps

2. **Complete** Azure setup
   - [ ] Follow AI guidance for Azure login and subscription selection
   - [ ] Answer questions about tenant and subscription preferences
   - [ ] Validate Azure connectivity and access
   - **Expected result**: Azure environment properly configured for deployment

3. **Understand** the deployment target
   - [ ] Learn about the full-single-node-cluster blueprint through AI explanation
   - [ ] Ask: *"What will this deployment create and why is this a good starting point?"*
   - **Success check**: Clear understanding of what you're about to deploy and its purpose

### Task 2: Interactive Parameter Configuration (10 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Configure deployment parameters using AI-assisted guidance

**Steps**:

1. **Configure** deployment parameters
   - [ ] Follow AI guidance to set deployment parameters (location, naming, etc.)
   - [ ] Use the checklist approach for parameter configuration
   - [ ] Ask questions about parameters you don't understand
   - **Expected result**: Properly configured deployment parameters

2. **Validate** configuration choices
   - [ ] Review the complete parameter configuration with AI assistance
   - [ ] Ask: *"Can you explain why these parameter choices make sense for my first deployment?"*
   - [ ] Make any needed adjustments based on your specific needs
   - **Expected result**: Confident understanding of your deployment configuration

3. **Prepare** for deployment execution
   - [ ] Confirm final configuration with AI guidance
   - [ ] Understand what the deployment process will do
   - **Success criteria**: Ready to execute deployment with clear expectations

### Task 3: Deployment Execution and Validation (15 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Execute the deployment and validate success using AI assistance

**Steps**:

1. **Execute** the deployment
   - [ ] Follow AI guidance to start the deployment process
   - [ ] Monitor deployment progress with AI assistance for any issues
   - [ ] Use error handling if any problems arise during deployment
   - **Expected result**: Successful deployment completion

2. **Validate** deployment success
   - [ ] Use AI assistance to verify that all components deployed correctly
   - [ ] Ask: *"How can I validate that my deployment was successful and what should I see in Azure?"*
   - [ ] Explore the deployed resources with AI guidance
   - **Expected result**: Confirmed successful deployment with understanding of deployed components

3. **Plan** next steps and cleanup
   - [ ] Use AI guidance to understand cleanup procedures
   - [ ] Learn about next development steps now that you have a working deployment
   - [ ] Practice cleanup process (or plan it for later)
   - **Success criteria**: Complete deployment experience with clear next steps and cleanup knowledge

## Validation

- [ ] Successfully used getting-started prompt for guided first deployment
- [ ] Completed Azure setup and subscription configuration through AI assistance
- [ ] Successfully deployed the full-single-node-cluster blueprint
- [ ] Validated deployment success and understood deployed components
- [ ] Learned cleanup procedures and next development steps

## Next Steps

**Continue Learning**: Try "Getting Started Advanced" kata for complex deployment scenarios and multi-cluster configurations

**Apply Skills**: Use systematic deployment approach for other blueprints and help team members with their first deployments
