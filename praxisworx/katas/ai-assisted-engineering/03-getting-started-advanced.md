## What You'll Learn

Master advanced AI-assisted onboarding and environment setup techniques for complex edge computing projects.

**Learning Objectives**:

- Configure complex development environments with multiple dependencies and multi-service orchestration
- Deploy interconnected systems and manage component dependencies with sophisticated deployment orchestration
- Handle enterprise-grade project initialization workflows using advanced AI assistance
- Troubleshoot complex setup scenarios with systematic AI-guided approaches

**Prerequisites**: Completion of Getting Started Basics kata, Edge Documentation Planning and Repository Analysis Planning katas (task planning foundation), experience with containers and deployment tools, intermediate development skills

**Real-World Context**: Enterprise edge computing projects require complex environment setups with multiple interdependent services, advanced deployment orchestration, and sophisticated configuration management. This kata teaches systematic approaches for handling these challenges efficiently.

## Practice Scenario

You're tasked with setting up a complex edge computing development environment that includes:

- **Multi-Component Services**: IoT data ingestion, edge AI inference, analytics processing, and enterprise integration
- **Advanced Dependencies**: Container orchestration, cloud services, networking configuration, and security setup
- **Deployment Orchestration**: Infrastructure as Code, automated deployment pipelines, and environment validation
- **Enterprise Integration**: Authentication systems, monitoring, and compliance requirements

**Your Challenge**: Use advanced AI-assisted techniques to efficiently configure and validate a complex multi-component development environment.

**Methodology**: Use advanced systematic setup: (1) Plan complex environment architecture, (2) Configure components with dependency management, (3) Validate integrated system functionality
