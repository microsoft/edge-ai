## AI-Assisted Engineering Katas

Streamlined practice exercises for building proficiency in AI-powered development workflows using tools like [GitHub Copilot][ms-github-copilot] and [VS Code][ms-vscode]. These optimized katas help you develop muscle memory for effective AI assistance patterns with minimal reading overhead, following [Microsoft's AI development best practices][ms-development-best-practices].

### What You'll Practice

- **AI Development Fundamentals**: Core AI assistance principles with action-oriented learning
- **Environment Setup**: Getting started with AI-assisted development tools with embedded guidance
- **Advanced Configuration**: Complex environment and tooling setup using streamlined approach

### Project Integration Resources

These katas leverage real project AI assistance tools:

- **Copilot Instructions**: Practice with [getting started instructions][getting-started-instructions] for context-aware assistance
- **AI Chat Modes**: Learn specialized modes from [GitHub chat configurations][github-chat-modes]
- **Getting Started Prompts**: Use [onboarding guidance][getting-started-guidance] for practical workflows

### Getting Started

**🚀 Quick Start with Training Mode:**

```bash
npm run docs:training
```

> ⏱️ **Build Time**:
>
> - **First run**: 2-4 minutes (installs dependencies + builds config)
> - **Subsequent runs**: Use `npm run docs:training-fast` for ~30 seconds startup

This automatically opens the documentation and navigates directly to PraxisWorx, providing immediate access to all AI-assisted engineering katas and learning resources.

**Prerequisites**: Ensure your development environment is set up according to the [general user setup guide][general-user-setup].

## Streamlined Kata Progression

Updated duration estimates reflect optimized, action-oriented structure

| Kata                                                     | Difficulty   | Duration | Focus                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| [01 - AI Development Fundamentals][kata-01-fundamentals] | Beginner     | 15 min   | AI-assisted development basics    |
| [02 - Getting Started Basics][kata-02-basics]            | Beginner     | 20 min   | Environment setup and onboarding  |
| [03 - Getting Started Advanced][kata-03-advanced]        | Intermediate | 25 min   | Complex environment configuration |

### Learning Progression

#### 01 - Foundation Level
