## Quick Context

**You'll Learn**: Master advanced AI-assisted deployment workflows for complex enterprise-scale edge deployments with multi-blueprint integration and sophisticated troubleshooting.

**Real Challenge**: You need to deploy a production-grade edge AI solution requiring multiple interconnected blueprints across Azure regions with high availability, disaster recovery, and compliance validation. The deployment involves complex dependencies and enterprise integration requirements.

**Your Task**: Plan and execute a sophisticated multi-blueprint deployment using AI assistance, handle complex deployment issues, and validate enterprise-grade compliance and operational requirements. Create two (2) blueprints, one representing cloud infrastructure and one representing and edge stamp. Onboard one or more, edge environments , usin VM as simulated edges, to understand production rollout scenarios.

### Essential Setup

**Required** (check these first):

- [ ] Completion of Deployment Basics kata
- [ ] Advanced familiarity with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Bicep)
- [ ] Azure CLI with enterprise subscription access and role assignments
- [ ] Access to multiple blueprints for integration practice

**Quick Validation**: Can explain blueprint dependencies and demonstrate deployment orchestration concepts.

## Practice Tasks

### Task 1: Multi-Blueprint Dependency Analysis and Planning (15 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Analyze complex deployment scenarios with multiple interconnected blueprints and create sophisticated deployment orchestration plans.

**Steps**:

1. **Analyze** multi-blueprint deployment requirements
   - [ ] Use GitHub Copilot Chat to understand blueprint dependencies and deployment sequence
   - [ ] Focus on: resource sharing, configuration inheritance, validation checkpoints
   - **Expected result**: Clear understanding of complex deployment architecture and dependencies

2. **Design** resource sharing and orchestration strategy
   - [ ] Map outputs from foundation blueprints to inputs of dependent blueprints
   - [ ] Plan configuration management and parameter inheritance patterns
   - **Expected result**: Comprehensive resource sharing strategy with dependency mapping

3. **Create** deployment plan with risk mitigation
   - [ ] Identify potential failure points and rollback procedures
   - [ ] Define validation checkpoints between blueprint deployments
   - **Success check**: Detailed deployment plan with risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Task 2: Advanced Multi-Blueprint Deployment Execution (60 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Execute sophisticated deployment orchestration with enterprise-grade validation and compliance checking.

**Steps**:

1. **Execute** systematic multi-blueprint deployment
   - [ ] Deploy foundation cloud blueprint first, validate outputs and readiness
   - [ ] Progress through dependent edge blueprints with validation checkpoints
   - [ ] Monitor deployment progress of edge stamps and handle dependency coordination
   - **Expected result**: Successful multi-blueprint deployment with validated integrations

2. **Implement** enterprise compliance and validation procedures
   - [ ] Apply security validation and compliance checking between deployments
   - [ ] Validate enterprise integration points and operational requirements
   - [ ] Document deployment progress for audit and compliance purposes
   - **Expected result**: Enterprise-grade deployment with comprehensive validation

3. **Validate** overall system functionality and operational readiness
   - [ ] Test end-to-end functionality across all deployed blueprints
   - [ ] Verify successful deployment and cloud collected telemetry from multiple edge stamps
   - **Success criteria**: Complete system validation with operational excellence demonstrated

### Task 3: Advanced Troubleshooting and Recovery Procedures (75 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Practice sophisticated troubleshooting for complex multi-blueprint deployment failures and implement advanced recovery procedures.

**Steps**:

1. **Diagnose** complex multi-blueprint deployment issues, e.g. unregister and Azure provider during deployment
   - [ ] Use AI assistance to systematically analyze failure propagation across blueprints
   - [ ] Identify root causes in resource dependencies and configuration conflicts
   - [ ] Apply advanced troubleshooting techniques for enterprise environments
   - **Expected result**: Clear diagnosis of complex deployment issues with systematic resolution approach

2. **Implement** advanced recovery and rollback procedures
   - [ ] Execute sophisticated roll-forward procedures for multi-blueprint deployments
   - [ ] Apply deployment recovery procedures and validate business continuity for existing edge stamps
   - [ ] Consider deploying edges across multiple Azure regions and resource groups
   - **Expected result**: Successful recovery with validated disaster recovery capabilities

3. **Document** advanced troubleshooting procedures and preventive measures
   - [ ] Create comprehensive troubleshooting documentation for enterprise teams
   - [ ] Document lessons learned and improvement recommendations
   - **Success criteria**: Enterprise-ready troubleshooting documentation and recovery procedures

## Completion Check

**You've Succeeded When**:

- [ ] Successfully planned and executed complex multi-blueprint deployment with sophisticated orchestration
- [ ] Demonstrated advanced troubleshooting capabilities for enterprise-scale deployment failures
- [ ] Validated enterprise compliance, security, and operational excellence requirements
- [ ] Created comprehensive documentation suitable for enterprise audit and operational use

## Next Steps

**Apply Skills**: Use these advanced techniques for real-world enterprise edge AI deployment scenarios and production environments
