## Edge Deployment Katas

Streamlined practice for mastering AI-assisted deployment workflows specifically for edge computing platforms. These optimized exercises build expertise in infrastructure as code deployment with minimal reading overhead.

### What You'll Practice

- **Deployment Workflows**: Systematic deployment planning and execution with embedded guidance
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform and Bicep deployment patterns using action-oriented approach
- **Troubleshooting**: Advanced deployment issue resolution with streamlined structure

### Project Integration Resources

These katas integrate with real project components for practical experience:

- **Edge Blueprints**: Practice with [full-single-node-cluster][full-single-node-cluster] and [minimum-single-node-cluster][minimum-single-node-cluster]
- **Edge Components**: Explore [IoT Operations deployment][iot-ops-deployment] and [CNCF cluster setup][cncf-cluster-setup]
- **Cloud Integration**: Learn with [messaging components][messaging-components] and [observability setup][observability-setup]

## Streamlined Kata Progression

Updated duration estimates reflect optimized, action-oriented structure

| Kata                                     | Difficulty | Duration | Focus                         |
|------------------------------------------|------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| [01 - Deployment Basics][kata-01-basics] | Beginner   | 60 min   | Blueprint deployment workflow |
| [05 - Deployment Expert][kata-05-expert] | Expert     | 240 min  | Complex multi-component setup |

## Learning Progression

### 01 - Foundation Level

- **Focus**: Deployment Basics with streamlined approach
- **Scenario**: Single-node edge cluster deployment
- **Skills**: Blueprint execution, basic troubleshooting, deployment validation
- **Time-to-Practice**: Under 5 minutes with optimized structure

### 02 - Advanced Level

- **Focus**: Advanced deployment with action-oriented content
- **Scenario**: Multi-component edge platform setup
- **Skills**: Complex infrastructure deployment, advanced troubleshooting, integration testing
- **Time-to-Practice**: Immediate engagement with deployment workflows

## Practice Recommendations

### First Time

Start with **01 - Deployment Basics** to learn deployment fundamentals using streamlined, action-oriented approach.

### Skill Building

- **Efficient Practice**: Optimized structure builds deployment skills faster
- **Real Application**: Apply deployment patterns to actual edge projects
- **Progressive Complexity**: Build from basic blueprints to complex multi-component setups

## Real-World Application

These streamlined katas prepare you for:

- **Edge Platform Deployment**: Systematic deployment of complex edge systems
- **Infrastructure Management**: AI-assisted infrastructure as code practices
- **Deployment Automation**: Streamlined deployment workflows and troubleshooting
- **Production Operations**: Real-world edge deployment and maintenance

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of cloud infrastructure concepts
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Azure subscription access (for hands-on practice)
- Ready to engage with deployment practice immediately
