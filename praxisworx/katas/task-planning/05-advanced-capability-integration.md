## What You'll Learn

Master complex task planning for multi-component system integration through predictive maintenance scenario planning.

**Learning Objectives**:

- Master complex task planning for multi-component system integration
- Apply systematic planning to sophisticated edge computing scenarios
- Create comprehensive plans balancing technical complexity with business requirements
- Understand dependency management and risk mitigation in complex implementations

**Prerequisites**: Completion of previous task planning katas, advanced edge computing concepts, multi-component system experience

**Real-World Context**: Manufacturing operations require integrated predictive maintenance systems combining IoT data collection, edge AI inference, real-time analytics, and enterprise integration. This kata teaches systematic planning to coordinate multiple platform capabilities and manage complex dependencies.

## Practice Scenario

A manufacturing facility needs comprehensive predictive maintenance for critical equipment. The solution requires integrating multiple edge computing capabilities:

- **IoT Data Collection**: Sensor data from machinery (vibration, temperature, pressure)
- **Edge AI Inference**: Real-time anomaly detection and failure prediction models
- **Data Analytics**: Historical analysis and pattern recognition for maintenance optimization
- **Enterprise Integration**: ERP system integration for automated work order generation
- **Alerting Systems**: Multi-channel notifications for immediate response to critical issues

**Your Challenge**: Create a systematic task plan that coordinates all these capabilities into a cohesive predictive maintenance system with proper dependency management and risk mitigation.

**Methodology**: Use multi-component planning: (1) Map capability dependencies and integration points, (2) Design coordinated implementation phases with parallel workstreams, (3) Plan validation and testing across integrated components

## Tasks

### Task 1: Capability Integration Architecture (20 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Design integration architecture mapping all components and dependencies

**Steps**:

1. **Map** capability components and their integration points
   - [ ] IoT sensor integration patterns and data flows
   - [ ] Edge AI model deployment and inference pipelines
   - [ ] Analytics engine integration with historical and real-time data
   - [ ] Enterprise system APIs and data synchronization requirements
   - **Expected result**: Comprehensive architecture diagram with all integration touchpoints

2. **Identify** critical dependencies and sequencing requirements
   - [ ] Infrastructure dependencies (edge compute, networking, storage)
   - [ ] Data flow dependencies between components
   - [ ] Validation and testing dependencies across integrated systems
   - **Expected result**: Dependency matrix with critical path identification

3. **Design** risk mitigation strategies
   - [ ] Technical risks: integration failures, performance bottlenecks, data quality issues
   - [ ] Business risks: stakeholder alignment, timeline coordination, resource allocation
   - **Success check**: Risk assessment with mitigation plans for each component integration

### Task 2: Multi-Workstream Implementation Planning (20 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Create coordinated implementation plan with parallel workstreams

**Steps**:

1. **Structure** parallel workstreams with clear coordination points
   - [ ] Infrastructure workstream: Edge compute, networking, security setup
   - [ ] Data workstream: IoT integration, data pipelines, storage configuration
   - [ ] AI/ML workstream: Model development, deployment, inference optimization
   - [ ] Integration workstream: Enterprise system connections, API development
   - **Expected result**: Workstream organization with defined responsibilities and coordination points

2. **Plan** integration milestones and validation checkpoints
   - [ ] Component-level validation: Individual capability testing
   - [ ] Integration validation: End-to-end flow testing
   - [ ] Business validation: User acceptance and performance criteria
   - **Expected result**: Milestone plan with clear validation criteria for each integration point

### Task 3: Comprehensive Implementation Task Plan (10 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Create detailed task plan with dependency management and stakeholder coordination

**Steps**:

1. **Detail** implementation tasks with clear ownership and timelines
   - [ ] Research: Technology evaluation and integration pattern analysis
   - [ ] Design: Detailed architecture and interface specifications
   - [ ] Implementation: Component development and integration execution
   - [ ] Validation: Testing across all integration points and business scenarios
   - **Expected result**: Complete task breakdown with realistic timelines and resource allocation

2. **Include** stakeholder coordination and governance framework
   - [ ] Cross-functional team coordination procedures
   - [ ] Decision-making processes for integration conflicts
   - [ ] Quality gates and approval processes for each major milestone
   - **Success criteria**: Enterprise-ready task plan with comprehensive governance and coordination framework

## Validation

- [ ] Comprehensive integration architecture with all capability touchpoints mapped
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies for technical and business integration challenges
- [ ] Parallel workstream organization with clear coordination and dependency management
- [ ] Detailed implementation tasks with realistic timelines and resource allocation
- [ ] Stakeholder coordination framework ensuring successful multi-component delivery
