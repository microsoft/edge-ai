## What You'll Learn

Master AI-assisted PR generation through systematic git analysis and structured documentation workflows.

**Learning Objectives**:

- Practice systematic PR generation workflow from git analysis to final documentation
- Apply AI-assisted development tools to automate PR description creation
- Create comprehensive PR descriptions with security validation and technical documentation
- Understand git analysis patterns for accurate change documentation

**Prerequisites**: Completion of previous task planning katas, git workflow experience, GitHub Copilot Chat access

**Real-World Context**: Development teams need efficient workflows for creating comprehensive PR descriptions that accurately document changes, security implications, and business value. This kata teaches systematic approaches using AI assistance for thorough git analysis and professional documentation.

## Practice Scenario

You have completed development work on edge computing components and need to create a comprehensive PR that documents:

- **Change Analysis**: Systematic review of git changes, file modifications, and impact assessment
- **Security Validation**: Analysis of security implications and compliance requirements
- **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive description with business value and technical details
- **Review Preparation**: Structured presentation for efficient code review process

**Your Challenge**: Create a systematic task plan for generating professional PR descriptions using AI-assisted analysis that ensures complete documentation and security validation.

**Methodology**: Use systematic PR generation: (1) Analyze git changes comprehensively, (2) Generate structured documentation with AI assistance, (3) Validate security and compliance requirements
