### Essential Setup

**Required** (check these first):

- [ ] Completion of Prompt Creation and Refactoring Workflow kata
- [ ] Your `terraform-module-generator.prompt.md` file from kata 01
- [ ] Access to project prompt examples in `.github/prompts/` directory
- [ ] GitHub Copilot subscription active

**Quick Validation**: Can open your kata 01 prompt file and access professional prompt examples for comparison.

## Practice Tasks

### Task 1: Prompt Structure Analysis and Gap Identification (12 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Analyze your existing Terraform prompt against professional standards and identify specific improvement areas.

**Steps**:

1. **Compare** your prompt against professional examples
   - [ ] Review 2-3 prompts from `.github/prompts/` directory
   - [ ] Identify structural differences and missing components
   - [ ] Note organizational issues and clarity problems
   - **Expected result**: Clear understanding of professional prompt structure standards

2. **Evaluate** essential prompt components
   - [ ] Check YAML frontmatter, core directives, context organization
   - [ ] Assess process instructions for specificity and actionability
   - [ ] Review examples and validation criteria
   - **Expected result**: Comprehensive analysis of current prompt strengths and weaknesses

3. **Document** improvement areas systematically
   - [ ] Create detailed gap analysis comparing current vs. professional standards
   - [ ] Prioritize improvements by impact on prompt effectiveness
   - **Success check**: Clear roadmap for transforming prompt to professional quality

### Task 2: Core Directive Enhancement and Language Improvement (15 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Transform your prompt's instructions using professional imperative language and clear behavioral directives.

**Steps**:

1. **Enhance** YAML frontmatter and metadata
   - [ ] Ensure proper mode specification and clear description
   - [ ] Verify metadata follows project conventions
   - **Expected result**: Professional frontmatter that clearly defines prompt purpose

2. **Rewrite** core directives with imperative language
   - [ ] Transform weak language into strong imperatives (WILL, MUST, ALWAYS, NEVER)
   - [ ] Add behavioral control patterns and process control requirements
   - [ ] Include quality control measures and validation requirements
   - **Expected result**: Clear, commanding directives that eliminate ambiguity

3. **Improve** instruction clarity and specificity
   - [ ] Replace vague guidance with specific, actionable Terraform instructions
   - [ ] Add conditional logic for different infrastructure scenarios
   - [ ] Include error prevention guidance for common Terraform issues
   - **Success check**: Professional-quality directives with clear behavioral expectations

### Task 3: Context Optimization and Professional Integration (13 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Optimize context management and ensure your prompt meets enterprise standards for team adoption.

**Steps**:

1. **Optimize** context sections for relevance and clarity
   - [ ] Review context for completeness and infrastructure automation relevance
   - [ ] Remove unnecessary information and add missing essential context
   - [ ] Organize context using clear, logical sections
   - **Expected result**: Streamlined context that supports successful task completion

2. **Add** comprehensive examples and quality criteria
   - [ ] Include concrete examples of expected Terraform module structures
   - [ ] Provide specific illustrations of variable definitions and resource patterns
   - [ ] Define success measures and validation checkpoints
   - **Expected result**: Clear examples and quality criteria that guide effective output

3. **Validate** professional standards and team readiness
   - [ ] Ensure consistency with project prompt patterns and conventions
   - [ ] Test for reusability and maintainability for enterprise adoption
   - [ ] Verify proper markdown formatting and professional presentation
   - **Success criteria**: Enterprise-ready prompt that meets professional quality standards

## Completion Check

**You've Succeeded When**:

- [ ] Transformed your prompt structure to meet professional construction standards
- [ ] Applied imperative language patterns that eliminate instruction ambiguity
- [ ] Optimized context and examples for effective Terraform module generation
- [ ] Created enterprise-ready prompt suitable for team adoption and consistent results

## Next Steps

**Continue Learning**: Apply these construction principles to create additional infrastructure automation prompts

**Apply Skills**: Use professional prompt structure standards for creating enterprise-quality prompts in your work
