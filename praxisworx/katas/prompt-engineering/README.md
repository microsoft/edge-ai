## Prompt Engineering Katas

Streamlined practice for building proficiency in prompt creation, optimization, and systematic engineering workflows following [Azure OpenAI prompt engineering principles][prompt-engineering-azure]. These optimized exercises help you develop expertise in the complete prompt engineering lifecycle with minimal reading overhead.

### What You'll Practice

- **Prompt Creation**: Build effective prompts from source code analysis with embedded guidance
- **Systematic Workflows**: Master the prompt-new and prompt-refactor processes using action-oriented approach
- **Optimization Techniques**: Learn to systematically improve prompt effectiveness with streamlined structure

### Project Integration Resources

These katas leverage real project prompt patterns:

- **Prompt Templates**: Practice with [project prompt examples][project-prompts] for practical patterns
- **Engineering Workflows**: Use [prompt creation processes][prompt-processes] for systematic development
- **Real Applications**: Reference [actual project prompts][actual-prompts] for production patterns

## Streamlined Kata Progression

Updated duration estimates reflect optimized, action-oriented structure
