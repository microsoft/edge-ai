## Quick Context

**You'll Learn**: Master the complete prompt engineering workflow from creation to optimization using structured analysis of existing code patterns.

**Real Challenge**: Your team needs to standardize Terraform infrastructure module creation. Analyze existing Terraform patterns in `src/000-cloud/` components and create an agent prompt that generates new modules following the same architectural patterns and organizational conventions.

**Your Task**: Use the prompt-new and prompt-refactor workflow to create a professional agent prompt that analyzes Terraform module structures and generates new modules with proper variables, resources, and outputs following project conventions.

I'm working on Prompt Creation and Refactoring Workflow kata and want interactive coaching with progress tracking and learning evaluation.
```

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Your coach can see your checkbox progress when you're using the local docs (`npm run docs:training`) and help you manage it!

### Essential Setup

**Required** (check these first):

- [ ] Completion of AI Development Fundamentals kata
- [ ] Familiarity with project structure and Terraform concepts
- [ ] GitHub Copilot subscription active
- [ ] Access to project source code in `src/000-cloud/` directory

**Quick Validation**: Can navigate to `src/000-cloud/` and identify Terraform module structures.

## Practice Tasks

### Task 1: Terraform Pattern Analysis and Initial Prompt Creation (15 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Analyze existing Terraform infrastructure patterns and use prompt-new to create a module generation prompt.

**Steps**:

1. **Analyze** Terraform components in `src/000-cloud/` directory
   - [ ] Select 1-2 components with clear Terraform module patterns
   - [ ] Review file structures, variable definitions, resource patterns, outputs
   - [ ] Identify key patterns: naming conventions, organization, tags, documentation
   - **Expected result**: Clear understanding of Terraform patterns to automate

2. **Use** prompt-new workflow for prompt creation
   - [ ] Open GitHub Copilot and use the prompt-new prompt file
   - [ ] Specify your selected Terraform component as `fromPath`
   - [ ] Set `toPath` to `.copilot-tracking/prompts/terraform-module-generator.prompt.md`
   - **Expected result**: Generated agent prompt that captures Terraform infrastructure patterns

3. **Review** generated prompt quality and completeness
   - [ ] Verify it captures variable patterns, resource organization, output specifications
   - [ ] Check for clarity of infrastructure-specific instructions
   - [ ] Document areas for improvement or missing patterns
   - **Success check**: Agent prompt ready for testing with clear Terraform automation capabilities

### Task 2: Strategic Terraform Prompt Enhancement (10 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Manually improve the generated prompt to address infrastructure pattern gaps and enhance clarity.

**Steps**:

1. **Identify** specific improvement opportunities
   - [ ] Review generated prompt against original Terraform components
   - [ ] Find gaps in variable validation, resource organization, output naming
   - [ ] Note unclear module generation steps or missing error handling
   - **Expected result**: Clear list of targeted improvements needed

2. **Make** focused Terraform-specific enhancements
   - [ ] Add clearer examples of variable validation from source infrastructure
   - [ ] Improve resource organization instructions based on actual patterns
   - [ ] Clarify output naming conventions found in existing modules
   - **Expected result**: Enhanced prompt with better infrastructure automation clarity

3. **Test** your enhanced prompt effectiveness
   - [ ] Use modified prompt to generate a sample infrastructure module
   - [ ] Evaluate if generated code follows project patterns and conventions
   - **Success check**: Generated Terraform code matches existing patterns and quality standards

### Task 3: Systematic Refactoring and Optimization (15 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Use prompt-refactor to systematically optimize your enhanced prompt for maximum effectiveness.

**Steps**:

1. **Execute** prompt-refactor workflow
   - [ ] Use prompt-refactor prompt file with your modified prompt as input
   - [ ] Leave focus empty for general refactoring or specify "organization"
   - [ ] Follow all steps: analysis, refactoring process, organizational improvements
   - **Expected result**: Systematically refactored prompt with improved structure and clarity

2. **Compare** workflow results and effectiveness
   - [ ] Compare original generated, manually enhanced, and refactored versions
   - [ ] Identify key improvements made during each phase
   - [ ] Assess overall clarity and usability improvements
   - **Expected result**: Clear understanding of each phase's contribution to prompt quality

3. **Document** lessons learned and workflow insights
   - [ ] Record what Terraform patterns were most valuable to capture
   - [ ] Note which manual changes had biggest impact on module generation
   - [ ] Document how refactoring improved the final prompt
   - **Success criteria**: Comprehensive understanding of prompt engineering workflow effectiveness

## Completion Check

**You've Succeeded When**:

- [ ] Created agent prompt that generates Terraform modules following project patterns
- [ ] Successfully enhanced prompt through manual improvements and systematic refactoring
- [ ] Demonstrated complete prompt engineering workflow from analysis to optimization
- [ ] Generated documentation showing workflow effectiveness and lessons learned

## Next Steps

**Continue Learning**: Practice with `02-basic-prompt-structure.md` for advanced prompt design principles

**Apply Skills**: Use this systematic prompt engineering workflow for creating and optimizing prompts in real development work
