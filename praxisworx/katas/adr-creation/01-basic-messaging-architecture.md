## Quick Context

**You'll Learn**: Create professional Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) using structured evaluation methodology for real-world technology choices.

**Real Challenge**: Your industrial IoT system needs to choose between MQTT and Apache Kafka for streaming sensor data from 500+ edge devices. The wrong choice could cost months of rework and impact system performance. You need to document this critical architecture decision professionally.

**Your Task**: Create a complete ADR following project standards that evaluates MQTT vs Apache Kafka for edge computing messaging, including research, trade-off analysis, and final recommendation with clear justification.
