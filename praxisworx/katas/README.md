## Overview

PraxisWorx Katas are short, focused practice exercises (15-45 minutes) designed for deliberate skill building through repetition and refinement. Inspired by martial arts training, these katas help engineers develop muscle memory for AI-assisted development patterns.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Focused Practice**: Single-skill exercises with clear objectives
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Build from beginner to expert level
- **Repetitive Learning**: Practice the same concepts to build proficiency
- **Quick Wins**: Complete exercises in 15-45 minutes

### Learning Philosophy

Katas emphasize:

- **Deliberate Practice**: Focused repetition of specific skills
- **Muscle Memory**: Build automatic responses to common scenarios
- **Incremental Improvement**: Small, consistent progress over time
- **Practical Application**: Real-world scenarios and challenges

   ```bash
   npm run docs:training
   ```

   > ⏱️ **Build Time**:
   >
   > - **First run**: 2-4 minutes (installs dependencies + builds config)
   > - **Subsequent runs**: Use `npm run docs:training-fast` for ~30 seconds startup

   This automatically opens the documentation and navigates directly to PraxisWorx, giving you immediate access to all kata categories and learning paths.

   **Alternative:** Standard documentation mode:

   ```bash
   npm run docs
   ```

3. **Choose Category** - Navigate to PraxisWorx -> Katas and choose a kata based on your learning goals
4. **Start with Beginner** - Build foundation skills first
5. **Practice Regularly** - Consistent practice builds proficiency
