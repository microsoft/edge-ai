## PraxisWorx

***"Where AI Empowers Every Engineer to Achieve More"***

**Empower yourself to achieve proficiency in AI-assisted engineering through structured learning paths that build real-world expertise in edge-to-cloud systems.**

### What is Praxis?

*Praxis* (from Ancient Greek πρᾶξις - "practice, action") is the integration of thought and action, theory and practice. In engineering, praxis represents the synthesis of conceptual understanding with hands-on implementation - turning knowledge into capability through deliberate practice.

PraxisWorx embodies this philosophy by combining AI assistance with practical engineering challenges, empowering every engineer to achieve more and ensuring that learning translates directly into real-world engineering capabilities and better contributions to Edge-AI.

## Quick Start

**🚀 Training Mode:** Launch with one command to start your learning journey with access to all learning paths:

```bash
npm run docs:training
```

> ⏱️ **Build Time**:
>
> - **First run**: 2-4 minutes (installs dependencies + builds config)
> - **Subsequent runs**: Use `npm run docs:training-fast` for ~30 seconds startup

This automatically opens the documentation server and navigates directly to PraxisWorx, giving you instant access to all learning resources.

## Learning Paths

| Path                                                 | Time           | Best For                            | Start Here                                         |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **🥋 [Individual Practice (Katas)][katas-overview]** | 15-45 min each | Self-paced learning, skill building | [AI Development Fundamentals][ai-dev-fundamentals] |
