# Kata Template Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for creating new katas using the optimized template structure that eliminates redundancy between methodology and practice sections while maintaining learning effectiveness.

## Template Philosophy

The optimized kata template follows these core principles:

- **Action-Oriented Structure**: Get learners practicing within 5 minutes
- **Embedded Guidance**: Integrate methodology into practice tasks rather than separate sections
- **Minimal Reading Overhead**: Reduce documentation length by 50-70% while preserving learning objectives
- **Consistent Experience**: Standardized structure across all kata domains

## Template Structure

### Required Sections

#### 1. Front Matter

```yaml
---
title: XX - Descriptive Title
description: Brief description focusing on learning outcomes
author: Edge AI Team
ms.date: YYYY-MM-DD
ms.topic: kata
estimated_reading_time: X
difficulty: beginner|intermediate|advanced
duration: X-Y minutes
keywords:
  - praxisworx
  - domain-specific-tags
---
```

#### 2. What You'll Learn

- Single paragraph focusing on actionable skills
- Specific, measurable learning outcomes
- No theoretical background or extensive context

#### 3. Scenario

- Brief, real-world context (2-3 sentences)
- Clear business/technical problem statement
- Immediate relevance to edge computing or AI-assisted engineering

#### 4. Practice Tasks

- **Core Section**: Replace separate methodology and practice sections
- Embedded guidance within each task
- Step-by-step actionable instructions
- Built-in validation criteria

#### 5. Success Validation

- Clear completion criteria
- Specific deliverables or outcomes
- Self-assessment checklist

#### 6. Help Resources (Optional)

- Minimal reference links
- Essential tools or documentation only
- No extensive setup or prerequisite sections

### Removed/Consolidated Sections

The following sections from the original template should NOT be included:

- **Separate Methodology Section**: Integrate guidance into practice tasks
- **Extensive Prerequisites**: Minimal essential requirements only
- **Detailed Background**: Focus on immediate practice
- **Verbose Setup Instructions**: Streamline to essentials
- **Skill Development Theory**: Embed learning principles in tasks

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- **Direct and Actionable**: Use active voice and clear instructions
- **Concise Language**: Eliminate unnecessary words and explanations
- **Embedded Context**: Provide context within tasks, not separate sections
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity as needed during practice

### Duration Targets

- **Reading Time**: Under 5 minutes to start practicing
- **Total Duration**: Reduce by 40-60% from original kata times
- **Time-to-Practice**: Immediate engagement with hands-on work

### Content Reduction Strategies

1. **Merge Methodology into Practice**: Integrate "how" with "what"
2. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Remove repeated concepts between sections
3. **Focus on Essentials**: Keep only content directly supporting practice
4. **Use Progressive Enhancement**: Basic path with optional advanced elements

## Domain-Specific Adaptations

### AI-Assisted Engineering

- Emphasize immediate tool usage
- Embed prompt engineering within tasks
- Focus on workflow integration

### Task Planning

- Integrate planning methodology with execution
- Emphasize research-first approach within tasks
- Focus on actionable deliverables

### ADR Creation

- Embed decision framework within scenario analysis
- Focus on real technology choices
- Streamline documentation process

### Edge Deployment

- Integrate infrastructure knowledge with deployment tasks
- Focus on hands-on blueprint execution
- Emphasize troubleshooting within practice

### Prompt Engineering

- Combine creation and optimization techniques
- Focus on systematic improvement workflows
- Embed template development within practice

## Quality Standards

### Learning Effectiveness

- All original learning objectives preserved
- Faster skill acquisition through action-oriented approach
- Improved retention through immediate practice

### Professional Standards

- Consistent formatting and structure
- Clear navigation and progression
- Professional tone and terminology

### Technical Standards

- Valid markdown formatting
- Working internal and external links
- Proper relative path references

## Implementation Process

### Creating New Katas

1. **Start with Template**: Use the optimized template structure
2. **Define Learning Objectives**: Clear, measurable outcomes
3. **Design Practice Tasks**: Action-oriented, embedded guidance
4. **Validate Content**: Ensure 50%+ reduction while preserving objectives
5. **Test Navigation**: Verify all links and references work

### Updating Existing Katas

1. **Analyze Current Structure**: Identify methodology/practice redundancy
2. **Consolidate Sections**: Merge methodology into practice tasks
3. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Remove repeated or unnecessary content
4. **Preserve Learning Objectives**: Ensure all essential skills remain
5. **Validate Reduction**: Confirm significant content reduction achieved

## Success Criteria

A well-implemented optimized kata should achieve:

- **Content Reduction**: 50-70% reduction in total line count
- **Time-to-Practice**: Under 5 minutes reading before hands-on work
- **Learning Preservation**: All original learning objectives maintained
- **Professional Quality**: Consistent structure and clear navigation
- **User Experience**: Streamlined, action-oriented learning experience

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Review

- Verify links remain valid
- Update content for technology changes
- Maintain consistency across domain

### Continuous Improvement

- Gather feedback on learning effectiveness
- Monitor completion times and user satisfaction
- Iterate on structure based on real usage patterns

### Quality Assurance

- Regular markdown linting validation
- Cross-reference navigation integrity
- Consistent application of template guidelines
