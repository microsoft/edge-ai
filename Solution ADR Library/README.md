# Solution ADR Library

The Solution ADR library are real, though anonymized, architectural decision records from ISE's own customer projects. These ADRs expose the decision making factors, constraints, and context for a breadth of decisions that must be made when building edge computing solutions. The maintainers of this repository encourage wholesale reuse of this content, extension of existing ADRs with common customer requirements, and contribution back to the library.
