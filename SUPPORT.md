Thank you for using the Edge AI Accelerator project! This document explains how to get help with issues, questions, and contributions.

## How to Get Support

### Community Support

Edge AI is an open-source project maintained by Microsoft and community contributors. We provide community support through GitHub issue tracking with the following response commitments:

| Priority Level             | Description                                      | Response Time Target           |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Security Vulnerability     | Security issues (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)) | 24 hours (via MSRC)            |
| Critical (Accessibility)   | Blocking accessibility issues                    | 1-2 business days              |
| Major (Accessibility)      | Significant accessibility issues                 | 3-5 business days              |
| General Issues & Questions | Bug reports, feature requests, questions         | 48-hour (24x6) response window |

**Note**: Response times indicate initial acknowledgment. Resolution time varies based on issue complexity and community availability.
