## Reference Appendix

### Help Resources

- [Documentation Framework][docs-structure] - Understanding the documentation system architecture and build process
- [Learning Platform][learning-readme] - Complete learning system capabilities and kata structures
- [Task Planner Custom Agent][task-planner-mode] - Systematic planning assistance for complex extractions
- [Task Implementation Instructions][task-implementation] - Systematic execution methodology for deliverable packaging
- [Kata Coach][kata-coach] - Interactive learning support and progress tracking system

### Professional Tips

- **Extend Existing Scripts**: Build on your AI Asset Extraction script rather than starting from scratch - add documentation and learning platform support incrementally
- **Test Documentation Builds**: Always test documentation framework integration in isolation before combining with learning platform to isolate build issues
- **Preserve Client Branding**: Design integration scripts to maintain client visual identity and terminology while adding Edge-AI capabilities
- **Business Context First**: Customize learning content with client-specific scenarios before packaging to ensure relevance and immediate value
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Create validation checklists for documentation framework, learning platform, and integration script components separately
- **Version Control Strategy**: Package extraction deliverables in a way that supports future updates and capability additions for long-term client value

### Troubleshooting

- **Documentation Build Conflicts**: If documentation framework integration breaks client builds, isolate the navigation system first - merge `_sidebar.md` and `_navbar.md` manually to understand conflicts before automating
- **Learning Platform Customization Issues**: When business context customization feels overwhelming, start with terminology replacement only - update client platform names and role titles first, then expand to scenario customization
- **Integration Script Complexity**: If integration script grows too complex, break into three separate scripts (documentation framework, learning platform, validation) with a main orchestration script for maintainability
