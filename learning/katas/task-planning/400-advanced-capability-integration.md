## Practice Tasks

### Task 1: Capability Integration Architecture (20 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Design integration architecture mapping all components and dependencies

**Steps**:

1. **Map** capability components and their integration points
   - [ ] IoT sensor integration patterns and data flows
   - [ ] Edge AI model deployment and inference pipelines
   - [ ] Analytics engine integration with historical and real-time data
   - [ ] Enterprise system APIs and data synchronization requirements
   - [ ] **Expected result**: Comprehensive architecture diagram with all integration touchpoints

2. **Identify** critical dependencies and sequencing requirements
   - [ ] Infrastructure dependencies (edge compute, networking, storage)
   - [ ] Data flow dependencies between components
   - [ ] Validation and testing dependencies across integrated systems
   - [ ] **Expected result**: Dependency matrix with critical path identification

3. **Design** risk mitigation strategies
   - [ ] Technical risks: integration failures, performance bottlenecks, data quality issues
   - [ ] Business risks: stakeholder alignment, timeline coordination, resource allocation
   - [ ] **Success check**: Risk assessment with mitigation plans for each component integration

### Task 2: Multi-Workstream Implementation Planning (20 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Create coordinated implementation plan with parallel workstreams

**Steps**:

1. **Structure** parallel workstreams with clear coordination points
   - [ ] Infrastructure workstream: Edge compute, networking, security setup
   - [ ] Data workstream: IoT integration, data pipelines, storage configuration
   - [ ] AI/ML workstream: Model development, deployment, inference optimization
   - [ ] Integration workstream: Enterprise system connections, API development
   - [ ] **Expected result**: Workstream organization with defined responsibilities and coordination points

2. **Plan** integration milestones and validation checkpoints
   - [ ] Component-level validation: Individual capability testing
   - [ ] Integration validation: End-to-end flow testing
   - [ ] Business validation: User acceptance and performance criteria
   - [ ] **Expected result**: Milestone plan with clear validation criteria for each integration point

### Task 3: Comprehensive Implementation Task Plan (10 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Create detailed task plan with dependency management and stakeholder coordination

**Steps**:

1. **Detail** implementation tasks with clear ownership and timelines
   - [ ] Research: Technology evaluation and integration pattern analysis
   - [ ] Design: Detailed architecture and interface specifications
   - [ ] Implementation: Component development and integration execution
   - [ ] Validation: Testing across all integration points and business scenarios
   - [ ] **Expected result**: Complete task breakdown with realistic timelines and resource allocation

2. **Include** stakeholder coordination and governance framework
   - [ ] Cross-functional team coordination procedures
   - [ ] Decision-making processes for integration conflicts
   - [ ] Quality gates and approval processes for each major milestone
   - [ ] **Success criteria**: Enterprise-ready task plan with comprehensive governance and coordination framework

## Completion Check

Have you achieved advanced capability integration planning excellence?

1. **Comprehensive Integration Architecture**: Can you design integration architecture mapping all capability touchpoints, data flows, and system dependencies with clear integration patterns and coordination points?
2. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Have you identified technical and business integration challenges with comprehensive mitigation strategies addressing performance, data quality, and stakeholder alignment?
3. **Multi-Workstream Coordination**: Can you structure parallel workstreams with clear responsibility matrices, coordination procedures, and governance frameworks for complex system delivery?
4. **Enterprise Planning Expertise**: Have you demonstrated advanced planning methodology suitable for complex multi-component integrations with realistic timelines, resource allocation, and stakeholder management?

### Help Resources

- **Task Planning Chat Mode** (`.github/chatmodes/task-planner.chatmode.md`): Advanced planning methodology for multi-component integration scenarios with dependency management and stakeholder coordination
- **Azure IoT Edge Documentation**: Edge computing integration patterns, deployment strategies, and best practices for IoT and AI workload orchestration
- **Azure Solution Accelerators**: Enterprise integration examples demonstrating predictive maintenance architectures and multi-component system coordination

### Professional Tips

- Start with dependency mapping to identify critical integration points and sequencing requirements before detailed planning
- Design clear coordination mechanisms between parallel workstreams ensuring integration points are well-defined and managed
- Balance comprehensive governance with agile execution - use lightweight coordination for routine decisions, formal governance for critical milestones

### Troubleshooting

- **Integration Architecture Too Complex**: Focus on critical integration points first (IoT→Edge AI→Analytics→Enterprise), add secondary capabilities incrementally
- **Workstream Coordination Unclear**: Define explicit integration milestones where workstreams must synchronize, establish clear ownership for each coordination point
