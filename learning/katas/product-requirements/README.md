# Success Criteria & Assessment
success_criteria:
  - Demonstrate effective PRD creation using AI assistance
  - Apply systematic requirements gathering workflows
  - Build comprehensive PRDs with stakeholder analysis and success metrics
  - Validate requirements are measurable and achievable
common_pitfalls:
  - "Vague user stories without acceptance criteria": Always include specific, testable acceptance criteria
  - "Missing stakeholder perspectives": Consider needs of all user personas, not just primary users
  - "Unmeasurable success metrics": Define quantifiable targets (e.g., '95% uptime' not 'high availability')"

  **Common Issues:**
  - PRD agent responses too generic: Provide more specific context about edge device types, alert categories, and operational constraints
  - User stories lack technical detail: Use follow-up prompts asking for implementation approaches and technology stack recommendations
  - Missing stakeholder perspectives: Always consider primary, secondary, and tertiary user personas
