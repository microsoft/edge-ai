## Practice Tasks

### Task 1: Enterprise Context and Technical Requirements Analysis (15 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Define comprehensive enterprise scenario and analyze technical architecture requirements for multi-facility Edge AI transformation.

**Steps**:

1. **Create** enterprise context using edge-ai-project-planner
   - [ ] Define multi-facility manufacturing scenario with diverse requirements
   - [ ] Specify technical constraints including governance and standardization needs
   - [ ] Focus on: shared platform capabilities, facility-specific customizations, integration requirements
   - [ ] **Expected result**: Comprehensive enterprise scenario with technical architecture scope

2. **Analyze** capability architecture requirements
   - [ ] Request comprehensive capability analysis for shared platform components
   - [ ] Identify scenario-specific technical requirements and dependencies
   - [ ] Map technical capabilities to business requirements across facilities
   - [ ] **Expected result**: Detailed technical capability architecture with shared vs. specialized components

3. **Define** architectural constraints and standards
   - [ ] Establish technical governance requirements and platform standards
   - [ ] Define integration patterns and data architecture requirements
   - [ ] **Success check**: Clear technical architecture framework with governance standards

### Task 2: Multi-Facility Technical Architecture Design (25 minutes)

**What You'll Do**: Design detailed technical architecture that optimizes shared capabilities while accommodating facility-specific requirements.

**Steps**:

1. **Design** shared platform architecture
   - [ ] Create comprehensive shared capability architecture with optimal component reuse
   - [ ] Define edge platform standardization and cloud platform optimization strategies
   - [ ] Establish technical integration patterns and data flow architecture
   - [ ] **Expected result**: Optimized shared platform architecture with maximum reuse and standardization

2. **Plan** facility-specific customization framework
   - [ ] Design flexible architecture supporting diverse facility requirements
   - [ ] Create standardized customization patterns for different manufacturing types
   - [ ] Define deployment templates with local configuration management
   - [ ] **Expected result**: Flexible architecture framework supporting diverse facility needs

3. **Validate** implementation readiness and technical dependencies
   - [ ] Assess technical readiness levels for all architecture components
   - [ ] Identify external dependencies and integration complexity
   - [ ] Define technical risk mitigation strategies and fallback procedures
   - [ ] **Success criteria**: Complete technical readiness assessment with risk mitigation

## Completion Check

**You've Succeeded When**:

- [ ] Successfully designed comprehensive enterprise architecture for multi-facility Edge AI transformation
- [ ] Created optimized shared platform architecture with maximum capability reuse
- [ ] Established flexible framework supporting diverse facility-specific requirements
- [ ] Validated technical implementation readiness with comprehensive risk assessment

## Reference Appendix

### Help Resources

- **Architecture Resources**: `/docs/project-planning/templates/enterprise-architecture.md` for architectural patterns and frameworks
- **Strategic Planning**: `/docs/project-planning/templates/strategic-plan.md` for comprehensive enterprise planning
- **Governance Templates**: `/docs/project-planning/templates/governance-framework.md` for decision-making frameworks
- **Reference Scenarios**: `learning/katas/project-planning/02-comprehensive-two-scenario.md` for practice with detailed scenario analysis

### Professional Tips

- Begin with business value drivers to align technical decisions with organizational priorities
- Use architectural patterns from previous successful implementations as templates
- Engage stakeholders early to validate assumptions and build organizational buy-in
- Document decision rationale for future reference and knowledge transfer

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Architecture plan seems disconnected from business objectives

- **Quick Fix**: Start with business capability mapping before defining technical architecture; validate each technical decision against specific business outcomes

**Issue**: Too many architectural options making decision-making difficult

- **Quick Fix**: Apply weighted decision matrix using criteria like ROI, risk, complexity, and time-to-value; prioritize options that deliver quick wins while enabling long-term vision
