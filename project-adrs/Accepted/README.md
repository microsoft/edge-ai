# Accepted State

Accepted ADRs are those that have been approved by the project leads, gone through an RFC process with the project community and have been committed to for future development effort.

Some ADRs in this directory may have a `S-` prefix indicating they are superseded by an ADR of the same name. The superseding ADR will have a three digit revision number suffix to identify it as replacing a previous ADR.
