# Development-only component with no buildable artifacts
# All services use pre-built images from public container registries
# Production deployment uses blueprints with Akri connector templates from MCR
# 
# This component provides:
# - Local Docker Compose development environment for testing media connector workflows
# - Mock RTSP cameras, MQTT broker, and monitoring tools
# - Integration examples (alert handlers, AI pipelines) that are buildable separately
#
# For production media connector deployment, see blueprints/full-single-node-cluster
