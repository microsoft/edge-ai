## Edge Applications

This directory contains application projects that can be built and deployed to edge or cloud systems. Applications are organized using a numbered folder structure (`5xx-application-name`) with each service containerized via Docker and deployed to Azure Container Registry (ACR). The `500-basic-inference` project serves as a reference implementation.

## Adding a New Application

To add a new application to this repository, follow these guidelines:

### Naming Convention

Create a new directory with the naming pattern `5xx-your-application-name` where `xx` represents the next available number in sequence.

### Required Files and Directories

Your application should include the following structure:

```text
5xx-your-application-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                  # Comprehensive component documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                       # Environment configuration template
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore                 # Git ignore patterns for the component
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml         # Local development and testing setup
â”œâ”€â”€ charts/                    # Helm charts for production deployment
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ your-service-name/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Chart.yaml
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ values.yaml
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ templates/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                      # Additional documentation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DOCKER_COMPOSE_README.md    # Local development guide
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ HELM_CHART_GUIDE.md         # Production deployment guide
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                   # Deployment and utility scripts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deploy-your-service.sh      # Automated deployment script
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ generate-env-config.sh      # Environment configuration generator
â”œâ”€â”€ resources/                 # Configuration and additional resources
â”œâ”€â”€ yaml/                      # Kubernetes manifests and other YAML files
â””â”€â”€ services/                  # Service implementations
    â”œâ”€â”€ service1/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/               # Source code
    â””â”€â”€ service2/
        â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Service Implementation

### Docker and Containerization

Each application must contain at least one `Dockerfile` within its respective service directory under `services/`. Use multi-stage builds to keep images small and secure by separating build and runtime environments.

Example multi-stage Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM python:3.9-slim AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install build dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy and install requirements
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip wheel --no-cache-dir --wheel-dir /app/wheels -r requirements.txt

# Runtime stage
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy wheels from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/wheels /wheels
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --no-index --find-links=/wheels/ /wheels/* \
    && rm -rf /wheels

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Service Structure and Resources

For each service in `services/`:

- Include language-specific dependencies (`Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`)
- Structure source code in `src/` directory
- Follow multi-stage build patterns with minimal runtime dependencies

The `resources/` folder should contain service-specific configuration files, templates, and sample data.

The `yaml/` folder should include Kubernetes manifests not covered by Helm charts (CRDs, storage, security policies).

## Local Development

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` template file with:

- Default values and comments for all configuration options
- Documentation of required vs optional variables
- Support for environment-specific configurations

> **Note**: The `.env` file should be added to `.gitignore` and not checked into the repository to avoid exposing sensitive configuration values.

Provide a `scripts/generate-env-config.sh` script for automated configuration setup and validation.

### Docker Compose Setup

Include a `docker-compose.yml` file for local development that:

- Enables running your complete application with `docker compose up`
- Includes required dependencies (databases, message brokers, etc.)
- Uses .env variables to simplify development
- Sets up proper networking and volume mounts

Example Docker Compose service configuration:

```yaml
services:
  your-service:
    build: ./services/your-service
    env_file:
      - .env  # Primary configuration file
    environment:
      # Only override critical local development settings
      - ENVIRONMENT=development
      - LOG_TO_CONSOLE=true
```

Testing with different `.env` files:

- **Default**: `docker compose up` (uses `.env`)
- **Debug**: `docker compose --env-file .env.debug up`
- **CI/CD**: `docker compose --env-file .env.ci up`

## Testing and Validation

Design your application to support:

- Local development with Docker Compose
- Automated environment setup and testing
- Clear separation between local and production configurations
- Comprehensive testing covering multiple deployment scenarios
- Test execution integrated into Docker builds with results saved to `/test-results`

## Production Deployment

### Helm Charts

Place production Helm charts in the `charts/` directory with:

- Standard structure: `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, `templates/`, `_helpers.tpl`
- Environment-specific value overrides and sensible defaults
- Proper secrets and configuration management
- Automated packaging and deployment via build pipeline

### Deployment Scripts

Create comprehensive deployment and testing scripts:

- `scripts/deploy-your-service.sh`: Automated deployment with rollback capabilities
- `scripts/test-docker-compose.sh`: Local testing with Docker Compose
- `scripts/test-kubernetes.sh`: Production testing in Kubernetes

## Documentation

Include comprehensive documentation:

- **Component README.md**: Overview, prerequisites, structure, deployment options, configuration, and troubleshooting
- **Specialized Documentation** in `docs/` folder:
  - `DOCKER_COMPOSE_README.md`: Local development guide
  - `HELM_CHART_GUIDE.md`: Production deployment guide

## Build Pipeline Integration

### Image Naming Convention

Images built from your application will follow this naming convention:

- For single-service applications:
  `<application-name-without-5xx>:YYYY-MM-dd-<short-commit-sha>`

- For multi-service applications:
  `<application-name-without-5xx>.<service-name>:YYYY-MM-dd-<short-commit-sha>`

For example:

- `basic-inference:2023-12-15-a1b2c3d` (single service)
- `basic-inference.pipeline:2023-12-15-a1b2c3d` (multi-service)

This naming convention is used by the build pipeline to properly tag and push images to the Azure Container Registry.
