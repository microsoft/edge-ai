🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧

This component will provide tooling and tutorials for deploying and managing workloads using the [Workload Orchestration for Azure Arc service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/workload-orchestration/overview).

## Overview

Workload Orchestration for Azure Arc  is an Azure-native service that enables organizations to orchestrate workloads across distributed Kubernetes clusters at scale. It provides:

- **Centralized Management**: Manage workloads across multiple clusters from Azure Portal
- **Policy-Based Placement**: Automatically place workloads based on cluster capabilities and constraints
- **Native Azure Integration**: Seamless integration with Azure services and RBAC
- **Fleet Management**: Organize and manage large fleets of edge clusters

## Coming Soon

This component is currently under development and will include:

- **Setup and Configuration**: Step-by-step guides for enabling workload orchestration
- **Placement Policies**: Examples of cluster selection and workload placement rules
- **Integration Tutorials**: End-to-end examples with edge applications
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Patterns for global workload distribution
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Tracking workload health across clusters
