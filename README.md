# ADR Process
All design decisions for direction, feature implementation, and community decisions happen throuh and ADR process. ADRs can be drafted by any contributors for consideration by project leads. Final ADR acceptance is performed via signoff from the project's Technal Lead (Bill Berry), Product Owner (Larry Lieberman), Technical Program Manager (Mack Renard), and Architect (Paul Bower).

ARD move through a process that includes the following states:

* Draft - for all ADRs under development and in a drafting phase. May be committed to the main branch directly by project administrators, but must be done in branches by community memebers
* Proposed - for all ADRs under review by the ADR signoff team (project leads), this phase is for discussion amongst project leads to ensure quality before they are opened to broad community engagement
* Accepted - for all ADRs that have received an "RFC" status. ADRs in this state will be presented to the project community for comment for no less than 5 business days, before ultimately being approved or denied by project administrators. 
* Deprecated - for all ADRs that are not relevant to the solution, it's active components or features, and should be retained for historical context.
