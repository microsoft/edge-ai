### 🏗️ Infrastructure Components ([`src/`](src/))

Modular, reusable building blocks:

- **Cloud services** (identity, data, messaging, observability)
- **Edge platforms** (Kubernetes, Azure IoT Operations)
- **Application frameworks** (AI inference, telemetry)

### 📋 Deployment Blueprints ([`blueprints/`](blueprints/))

Complete solution templates:

- **Single-node edge** deployments
- **Multi-node cluster** setups
- **Cloud-only** configurations
- **Minimal** proof-of-concept setups

### 📚 Documentation ([`docs/`](docs/))

Everything you need to know:

- **Getting started** guides for different roles
- **Architecture** decisions and design patterns
- **Contributing** guidelines and development workflow

## 🛠️ Quick Setup (Dev Container Recommended)

**Prerequisites:** Docker, VS Code, and GitHub Copilot (seriously, this repo is optimized for AI-assisted development)

```bash
# Clone and open in VS Code
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/edge-ai.git
cd edge-ai
code .

# When prompted, "Reopen in Container"
# Everything gets installed automatically 🎉
```

**Alternative:** [Manual setup instructions](docs/getting-started/development-environment.md) (for the brave)

> **Note on Telemetry:** If you wish to opt-out of sending telemetry data to Microsoft when deploying Azure resources with Terraform, you can set the environment variable `ARM_DISABLE_TERRAFORM_PARTNER_ID=true` before running any `terraform` commands.

## 🎨 What Makes This Project Different

- **Actually works in production** - empowering real deployments
- **Modular design** - enabling teams to build custom solutions that meet business needs
- **AI-assisted development** - optimized for GitHub Copilot to accelerate every engineer's productivity
- **Multiple IaC frameworks** - Terraform & Bicep
- **Comprehensive testing** - because empowering reliable edge infrastructure deployments is our mission
