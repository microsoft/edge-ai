# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Clone the CLI Repository (this solution is not available via package distribution - please update all components after cloning and file issues if challenges are encountered)
2.	Run the CLI locally using `{cli} create {solution_template_file_path} {target_environment} {output_format} 
3.	Collect output artifacts and execute in runtime of choice using output format tooling (instructions provided in output readme)

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# ADR Process
All design decisions for direction, feature implementation, and community decisions happen through and ADR process. ADRs can be drafted by any contributors for consideration by project leads. Final ADR acceptance is performed via sign-off from the project's Technical Lead (Bill Berry), Product Owner (Larry Lieberman), Technical Program Manager (Mack Renard), and Architect (Paul Bower).

ARD move through a process that includes the following states:

* Draft - for all ADRs under development and in a drafting phase. May be committed to the main branch directly by project administrators, but must be done in branches by community members
* Proposed - for all ADRs under review by the ADR sign-off team (project leads), this phase is for discussion amongst project leads to ensure quality before they are opened to broad community engagement
* Accepted - for all ADRs that have received an "RFC" status. ADRs in this state will be presented to the project community for comment for no less than 5 business days, before ultimately being approved or denied by project administrators. 
* Deprecated - for all ADRs that are not relevant to the solution, it's active components or features, and should be retained for historical context. 

# Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
