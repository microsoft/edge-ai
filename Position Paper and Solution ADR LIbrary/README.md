# Position Paper and Solution ADR Library

In this folder, users of this solution will find two types of material useful to the process of building and designing edge computing solutions using Microsoft products and offerings such as AIO, Arc, Fabric, etc.

## Position Papers

Position papers are short 5-7 page documents that can get users up-to-speed on the technology landscape for edge computing solutions. Papers typically focus on the key aspects of a technology or standard, and will map users out to further learning content to deepen the reader's expertise.

## Solution ADR Library

The Solution ADR library are real, though anonymized, architectural decision records from ISE's own customer projects. These ADRs expose the decision making factors, constraints, and context for a breadth of decisions that must be made when building edge computing solutions. The maintainers of this repository encourage wholesale reuse of this content.
