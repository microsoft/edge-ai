# Solution Technology Papers

The Solution Technology Paper library is a collection of short 5-7 page documents that can get engineers and program managers up-to-speed on the technology landscape for edge computing solutions. Papers typically focus on the key aspects of a technology or standard, and will map users to further learning content, to deepen the reader's expertise.

This library will include content for:

* Unified Namespace (UNS)
* Network Time Protocol
* Azure IoT Operations Tool Chain Orchestrator
* Layered Network Management, Arc Gateway & Purdue Networks
* GitOps with Flux for Azure IoT Operations
* Certificate-based remote access to edge environments

## Contributing

This project encourages the contribution of high-quality Technology Papers that have been developed in/for ISE engagements and end customers. Contributions require some normalization to a template format and removal of customer specific or NDA information. When contributing a Technology Paper to the project, please consider the following guidance:

* Review the existing Technology Papers in the library to see if an existing one can be extended or improved before contributing a new document.
* All Technology Papers must be formatted as Markdown documents and use the `.md` file extension
* All Technology Papers must follow the formatting of the [Security Plan template](./Security%20Plan%20Template.md)
* All Technology Papers must use short, concise, English file names
* Technology Papers may include optional language translations, please copy the Technology Paper and add an intermediate, language extension using appropriate ISO 639 language codes (e.g. `Impact of Clock Sync for Edge Systems.en.md` and `Impact of Clock Sync for Edge Systems.zh.md` for English and Chinese)
* Assign a workitem to yourself before beginning any effort, and set the item's status field accordingly.
* If a work item for your contribution does not exist, [please file an issue](https://dev.azure.com/ai-at-the-edge-flagship-accelerator/IaC%20for%20the%20Edge/_workitems/create/Issue) first to engage the project's PO, TPM, or Tech Lead for guidance.
* Commits (or at least one in a commit chain) should reference a User Story or Task item from the backlog for traceability.
* All Technology Papers must be reviewed by two reviewers including the following personnel:
  * Product Owner (Larry Lieberman) or TPM (Mack Renard)
  * Architect(s)/(Assistant) Technical Lead (Tim Park, Paul Bouwer, Bill Berry, etc.)
