# Generate Commit Message

Must follow all instructions provided by #file:../instructions/commit-message.instructions.md
Use the get_changed_files tool to get the staged changes.
Output to the user an appropriate commit message based on these changes in-between a markdown codeblock.

Example for a large change:
<!-- <example-response-large> -->
Here's a clean, conventional commit message based on the staged changed, copy it as-is and use for your commit:

```markdown
feat: add repo-wide instruction files including prompts and chatmodes

* add commit message, markdown, C# along with C# test instructions
* introduce task planner and researcher, prompt builder, and adr creation chatmodes
* configure markdownlint and VS Code workspace settings
* add ADO work items prompts for getting and preparing my work items
* add .gitignore and cleanup README newlines

<!-- </example-response-large> -->

Example for a medium change:
<!-- <example-response> -->
Here's a clean, conventional commit message based on the staged changed, copy it as-is and use for your commit:

```markdown
feat(prompts): update summarize-my-work-items.prompt.md to clarify json output, correct get-my-work-items.prompt.md to fallback to wit_my_work_items
