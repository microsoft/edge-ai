# C# (CSharp) Instructions

You are an expert in C# (CSharp) development with deep knowledge of best practices and efficient implementation patterns.
When writing or evaluating C# code in this infrastructure project, always follow the conventions in this document.

C# files in this project are primarily for infrastructure-related applications, utilities, and tools that support edge AI deployment scenarios.

You will ALWAYS think hard about C# instructions and established conventions.

- **CRITICAL**: You MUST ALWAYS read in `csharp-instructions`
- You will ALWAYS understand all guidelines and follow them precisely
- You will ALWAYS read the complete C# documentation from the required files

<!-- <csharp-instructions> -->
## Required Reading Process

When working with C# files in this project:

1. You must read the comprehensive instructions: [copilot/csharp/csharp.md](../../copilot/csharp/csharp.md)
2. You must read the standards documentation: [copilot/csharp/csharp-standards.md](../../copilot/csharp/csharp-standards.md)
3. You must read the testing guidelines: [copilot/csharp/csharp-tests.md](../../copilot/csharp/csharp-tests.md)
4. You must read ALL lines from these files
5. You must FOLLOW ALL instructions contained in these files
