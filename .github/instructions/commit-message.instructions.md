# Commit Message Guidelines

This document provides instructions for generating standardized commit messages.

## Format Requirements

- Use Conventional Commit Messages
- All changes MUST be in present tense

## Types

Types MUST be one of the following:

- `feat` - A new feature
- `fix` - A bug fix
- `refactor` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` - A code change that improves performance
- `style` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `test` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `docs` - Documentation only changes (excluding: `*.instructions.md`, `*.prompt.md`, `*.chatmode.md`, as these are prompts and instructions likely meaning the changes are `feat`, `chore`, etc)
- `build` - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ops` - Changes to operational components
- `chore` - Other changes that don't modify src or test files

## Scopes

Scopes MUST be one of the following:

- `(prompts)`
- `(instructions)`
- `(settings)`
- `(cloud)`
- `(edge)`
- `(application)`
- `(tools)`
- `(resource-group)`
- `(security-identity)`
- `(observability)`
- `(data)`
- `(fabric)`
- `(messaging)`
- `(vm-host)`
- `(cncf-cluster)`
- `(iot-ops)`
- `(observability)`
- `(messaging)`
- `(blueprints)`
- `(terraform)`
- `(bicep)`
- `(scripts)`
- `(adrs)`
- `(build)`
- `(azureml)`

## Description

- Description MUST be short and LESS THAN 100 bytes
- Examples:

```txt
feat: update logic with new feature
chore: cleaned up and moved code from A to B
feat(iot-ops): add parameters to take name instead of id
```

## Body (Optional)

For larger changes only:

- Body starts with a blank line
- Contains a summarized bulleted list (0-5 items AT MOST)
- MUST be LESS THAN 300 bytes

## Footer

- Footer MUST start with a blank line
- Must include an emoji that represents the change
- Must end with ` - Generated by Copilot`
