# Azure DevOps Work Items Planning File Instructions

ADO Work Item Project: edge-ai

<!-- <planning-folder-structure> -->
## Planning File Definitions & Directory Conventions

Root planning workspace structure:

```plain
.copilot-tracking/
  workitems/
    <planning-type>/
      <artifact-normalized-name>/
        artifact-analysis.md                    # Human-readable table + recommendations
        work-items.md                           # Human/Machine-readable plan (source of truth)
        handoff.md                              # Handoff for workitem execution (optionally references work-items.json if JSON variant produced)
        planning-log.md                         # Structured operational & state log (routinely updated sections)
```
**Normalization:**
* Lower-case, hyphenated base filename without extension (e.g. `docs/Customer Onboarding PRD.md` â†’ `docs--customer-onboarding-prd`).
* Avoid spaces and punctuation besides hyphens (replace with hyphens).
* Choose primary artifact when multiple artifacts and documents are provided or best effort.
<!-- </planning-folder-structure> -->

## Planning File Requirements

* Planning markdown files MUST start with:
  ```
  <!-- markdownlint-disable-file -->
  <!-- markdown-table-prettify-ignore-start -->
  ```
* Planning markdown files MUST end with (before last newline):
  ```
  <!-- markdown-table-prettify-ignore-end -->
  ```

## planning-log.md

* planning-log.md is a living document: sections are routinely added, updated, extended, and removed in-place.
* Iterating on any planning files requires updates to planning-log.md in order to track progress.
* Track all new, in-progress, and completed steps for Phases routinely.
* Update Status section with in-progress review of completed and proposed steps.
* Update Previous Phase when moving onto any other Phase (not required to be in-order (meaning, Phase-1 could be repeated after Phase-2 due to discovery)).
* Update Current Phase and Previous Phase when transitioning phases.

## Search Keyword & Search Text Protocol

Goal: Deterministic, resumable discovery of existing work items.

<!-- <search-keyword-protocol> -->
Steps:
1. Maintain ACTIVE KEYWORD GROUPS: ordered list, each group = 1-4 specific terms (multiâ€‘word allowed) joined by OR.
2. Compose `searchText`:
  * Single group â†’ `(term1 OR "multi word")`
  * Multiple groups â†’ `(group1) AND (group2)` etc.
3. Execute search (page size suggested: 50). For every related result ID:
  * Fetch full work item immediately and update planning-log.md.
  * Compute similarity (semantic intent focus, not token count).
  * Assign action via matrix.

Similarity Computation Guidance:
* Use combined semantic representation of (title + description + acceptance).
* Boost for aligned outcome/goal verbs; penalize scope or persona mismatch.
* Store raw float, round to 2 decimals for `similarity` field.
<!-- </search-keyword-protocol> -->

<!-- <similarity-decision-matrix> -->
| Similarity | Action | Interpretation                                 |
|------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| â‰¥ 0.70     | update | Strong alignment with existing item intent     |
| 0.50-0.69  | review | Potential alignment; needs manual confirmation |
| < 0.50     | create | No sufficiently aligned existing item          |
<!-- </similarity-decision-matrix> -->

<!-- <state-persistence-protocol> -->
## Routine State Persistence & Summarization Tool Call Protocol

* Must maintain planning-log.md routinely by keeping it up to date as information is discovered.

### Required Pre-Summarization
Summarization must also include the following (or else you will likely cause breaking changes):
* Full paths to all working files with a summary describing each file and its purpose
* Anything that was not captured into the planning-log.md file or other planning files that should have been captured before summarization
  * Specifically state exactly what needs to be done again (e.g., use the mcp_ado_wit_get_work_item tool with ID ### again, etc)
* Exact work item IDs that were already reviewed
* Exact work item IDs that are left to be reviewed
* Exact work item IDs that were already reviewed but likely not captured into the planning-log.md file or other planning files
* Exact planning steps that you were previously on (must repeat if data was not captured into planning files)
* Exact planning steps that are still required
* Any potential work item search criteria that is still required

### Required Post-Summarization Recovery
If context has `<summary>` and only one tool call, then immediately do the following protocol before any additional edits/decisions:

1. **State File Validation**:
  * It's likely you've lost valuable information and you are now required to recover your context to avoid broken changes
  * Use the `list_dir` tool under the `.copilot-tracking/workitems/<planning-type>/<artifact-normalized-name>` working folder
  * Use the `read_file` tool to read back in all of the planning-log.md to build back context

2. **Context Reconstruction User Update**:
  Let the user know that you are working on rebuilding your context:

  ```markdown
  ## Resuming After Context Summarization

  I notice our conversation history was summarized. Let me rebuild context:

  ðŸ“‹ **[Analyzing Title]**: [Analyze planning-log.md and current work item content]

  To ensure continuity, I'll do the following:
  * [List protocol that you plan to follow next]

  Would you like me to proceed with this approach?
  ```
