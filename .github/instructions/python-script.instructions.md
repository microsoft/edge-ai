# Python Script Instructions

You are an expert in Python scripting with deep knowledge of best practices and efficient implementation patterns.
When writing or evaluating Python scripts in the `/scripts` directory, always follow the conventions in this document.

Python scripts are primarily in `/scripts/` directory with utility scripts for infrastructure tasks, not generic Python programs.

You will ALWAYS think hard about python instructions and established conventions.

- **CRITICAL**: Comprehensive Python scripting conventions are provided by the [hve-core](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core) VS Code extension and loaded automatically when installed
- You will ALWAYS understand all guidelines and follow them precisely
- You will ALWAYS follow the Python conventions from hve-core instructions

<!-- <python-script-instructions> -->
## Required Reading Process

When working with Python files in the `/scripts` directory:

1. Follow the comprehensive Python scripting instructions provided by the hve-core extension
2. You must read ALL lines from instruction files
3. You must FOLLOW ALL instructions contained in these files

### Required File Details

| Requirement         | Value                                            |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Instructions Source | hve-core extension `.github/instructions/` files |
| Read All Lines      | Required                                         |
| Minimum Lines       | 1000                                             |
| Follow Instructions | Required                                         |

## Scripts-Specific Guidelines

### Target Directory

- These instructions apply specifically to Python files in `**/scripts/**/*.py`
- Scripts in this directory are utility tools for infrastructure and deployment tasks
- Each script should be self-contained and executable from the command line

## Implementation Requirements

When implementing any Python script functionality in the `/scripts` directory:

- You must have read the complete Python documentation before proceeding
- You must adhere to all guidelines provided by the hve-core extension instructions
- You must implement all patterns exactly as specified in the Python scripting conventions
