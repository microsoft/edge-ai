# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
#
# Purpose:
# This workflow builds and deploys documentation to GitHub Pages whenever documentation files are updated.
#
# Functionality:
# - Triggers via workflow_call (manually or from ci-cd.yml)
# - Sets up GitHub Pages environment
# - Builds documentation (configurable for various documentation generators)
# - Deploys built documentation to GitHub Pages
#
# Parameters:
# - source_branch: Branch to build documentation from
# - deploy_environment: Environment to deploy to (e.g., production, staging)
#
# Output Variables:
# - page_url: URL of the deployed GitHub Pages site
#
# Usage Examples:
# ```yaml
# # Called from another workflow:
# jobs:
#   deploy-docs:
#     uses: ./.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml
#     with:
#       source_branch: 'main'
#       deploy_environment: 'github-pages'
#
# # Direct call with custom branch:
# jobs:
#   deploy-docs:
#     uses: ./.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml
#     with:
#       source_branch: 'feature/improved-docs'
#       deploy_environment: 'staging'
# ```
#
# This workflow follows GitHub's best practices for Pages deployments and uses the
# recommended actions for setting up and deploying to GitHub Pages.
