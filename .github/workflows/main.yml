# Main Branch CI/CD Workflow
#
# Purpose:
# This workflow runs the continuous integration and deployment pipeline for the
# main branch,
# ensuring code quality and deploying documentation to GitHub Pages.
#
# Functionality:
# - Runs MegaLinter for static code analysis across multiple languages
# - Validates documentation standards and updates docs if needed
# - When code is pushed to the main branch (triggers deployment to
#   GitHub Pages)
# - Checks Azure IoT Operations component versions against latest published releases
# - Performs matrix-based validation of Terraform configurations
#
# Parameters:
# None - This workflow is triggered automatically on pushes to main branch
#
# Output Variables:
# None - Results are provided as GitHub checks, annotations, and artifacts
#
# Usage Examples:
# This workflow is automatically triggered on pushes to main branch and doesn't need manual invocation.
#
# This workflow helps maintain code quality on the main branch and keeps documentation
# up-to-date for users of the repository.
