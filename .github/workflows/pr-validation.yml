# Pull Request Validation Workflow
#
# Purpose:
# This workflow runs the CI/CD pipeline for pull requests to maintain code quality,
# validate infrastructure changes, and ensure readiness for merging to main branch.
#
# Functionality:
# - Detects changed files in the pull request to determine required validation steps
# - Runs MegaLinter for static code analysis across multiple languages
# - Validates Terraform configurations using init, validate, plan, and test operations
# - Checks Azure IoT Operations component versions against latest published releases
# - Ensures consistent documentation standards
# - Tests resource provider scripts in PowerShell and bash
#
# Parameters:
# None - This workflow is triggered automatically on pull requests to protected branches
#
# Output Variables:
# None - Results are provided as GitHub checks, annotations, and artifacts
#
# Usage Examples:
# This workflow is automatically triggered on pull requests and doesn't need manual invocation.
#
# This comprehensive validation workflow helps maintain code quality and prevents
# problematic code from being merged into the main branch.
