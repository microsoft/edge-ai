# Security Gate Configuration
# This file defines security thresholds and policies for CI/CD enforcement

# Vulnerability Thresholds
vulnerability:
  # Maximum severity level allowed (critical, high, medium, low, negligible)
  threshold: "high"

  # Maximum number of vulnerabilities by severity
  max_critical: 0
  max_high: 5
  max_medium: 20
  max_low: 50
  max_negligible: 100

# Infrastructure as Code Security
iac:
  # Whether to enforce IaC security policies (Checkov)
  enforce: true

  # Maximum number of IaC security violations allowed
  max_violations: 0

# Dependency Security
dependencies:
  # Whether to fail builds on dependency vulnerabilities
  fail_on_vulnerabilities: false

  # Languages to audit (all enabled by default)
  languages:
    - dotnet
    - rust
    - nodejs
    - python

  # Lockfile enforcement for supply chain security
  lockfiles:
    # Whether to enforce committed lockfiles (prevents TOCTOU attacks)
    enforce_lockfile_commits: true

    # Lockfile types to validate
    types:
      - rust-cargo      # Cargo.lock for Rust projects
      - npm             # package-lock.json for Node.js projects
      - pip             # requirements.txt with pinned versions
      - go-mod          # go.sum for Go projects

    # Whether to fail builds on missing lockfiles
    fail_on_missing: true

# Container Security
containers:
  # Whether to scan container images with Grype
  scan_images: true

  # Base image allowlist (empty means all allowed)
  allowed_base_images: []

# Reporting
reporting:
  # Output format (junit, json, sarif, console)
  format: "junit"

  # Whether to generate detailed vulnerability reports
  detailed_reports: true

  # Whether to upload reports to CI/CD artifacts
  upload_artifacts: true

# Environment-specific overrides
environments:
  # Development environment (more lenient)
  development:
    vulnerability:
      threshold: "medium"
      max_critical: 2
      max_high: 10
      max_medium: 50
    dependencies:
      fail_on_vulnerabilities: false

  # Production environment (strictest)
  production:
    vulnerability:
      threshold: "critical"
      max_critical: 0
      max_high: 0
      max_medium: 5
    dependencies:
      fail_on_vulnerabilities: true
