# ISE Security Checklist (SecureDev Program)

The Security Checklist aims to improve the baseline security posture of ISE engagements by focusing on fundamentals. The Security Checklist is a part of a larger program that provides a process, the ISE Security Checklist, automation, and a reporting tool for software development teams across ISE. By using the Security Checklist, dev crews (and customers) follow security best practices including: reviewing recommendations from Defender for Cloud, having conversations with the customerâ€™s security stakeholder(s) and ISE Security Champions, and delivering a Security Plan to the customer.

# Getting Started

  - Meet with the customer's Security Stakeholder(s)
  - Work with an ISE Security Champion
  - Complete a Security Plan
- Communicate your progress by entering it in the [Checklist Tool](https://aka.ms/ISEChecklist)
